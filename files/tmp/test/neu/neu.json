{"title":"And I Get Dressed: Review: Palihouse, West Hollywood","text":"April 29, 2015\nReview: Palihouse, West Hollywood\nOf all the places I travel for work or for pleasure, I'm in Los Angeles the most. It's funny, when you visit a place fairly regularly - you get into a routine. You stay at the same hotels, eat at the same places. Often, I can spend my entire 2-3 days in a square mile radius!\nThis trip, I knew I wanted a different experience. I'd venture out and stay at a hotel I've never been to and go for more of that home away from home feeling. I'd heard great things about Pali House - there's one in West Hollywood (where I stayed) and one in Santa Monica - so I figured I'd give it a try. I love boutique hotels with a bit of whimsey. The first photo is the view walking into the door. I was greeted by a very friendly front desk clerk who took my luggage down the stairs. Check it was easy and the elevator to the rooms are through this charming courtyard restaurant.\nI stayed in the Studio Residence which is basically a studio loft apartment that most New Yorkers would kill for. It's spacious, open and has a full kitchen. I didn't do any cooking in the three days I was here but the full size fridge was fab to have since I had guests over one day. The large marble bathroom is gorgeous - a little dark so no photos sorry!\nYou can check out the open floor plan here. Quite a large room and the sectional sofa can double as a spare bed. The glass door leads to patio, featured below. All in all a terrific hotel I would definitely stay again. Just don't take outfit photos in the courtyard outside your room - \"photo-shoots\" are apparently, a thing...\nBoyfriend Nightshirt *that I totally wore as clothes c\/o Simply Be, Kari Patent Sandals c\/o Long Tall Sally\nPhotos of me, Jessica Castro\nCurrently Coveting\n","title_lev":0.3333333333333333,"text_jar":0.84,"text_cosine":0.9866611561005342,"url":"http:\/\/www.andigetdressed.com\/2015\/04\/review-palihouse-west-hollywood.html"}

{"title":"kates-fashionblog: Herbst Favoriten #2","text":"Samstag, 1. November 2014\nHerbst Favoriten #2\nHeut zeig ich euch ein paar Dinge, die f√ºr mich typisch f√ºr den Herbst sind. Die Tage werden k√ºrzer, es wird schneller dunkel und k√§lter, somit verbringt man mehr Zeit drinnen. Ich trotze dem kalten und nassen Wetter dann meistens mit einer Serie und einer Tasse Tee, dazu meine Lieblingsschoko (Apple Crumble von Lindt! Yummy.) und ich bin gl√ºcklich. Au√üerdem kann ich endlich wieder meine geliebten Duftkerzen anz√ºnden!\nWie schon so oft erw√§hnt, geh√∂ren f√ºr mich kuschelige Pullis einfach zum Herbst. Oben seht ihr ein paar meiner liebsten, von Mango, Ralph Lauren und Zara. Schal, M√ºtze und Handschuhe sind morgens ein Muss f√ºr mich. Den karierten Schal von Zara kennt ihr vielleicht schon aus dem letzten Outfit , der schwarz-wei√üe Schal (nicht aktuell), die Handschuhe (aus dem letzten Jahr) und die M√ºtze (aktuell) sind von H&M.\nVor kurzem hab ich die Marke Kringle Candle Company f√ºr mich entdeckt. Schon im April bin ich durch Wien-Mitte darauf aufmerksam geworden, hab dann wieder darauf vergessen, bis die liebe Julia vor kurzem ein Bild dazu auf Instagram gepostet hat. Sie sind den Kerzen von Yankee Candle sehr √§hnlich, kein Wunder denn die Idee dazu kam vom Sohn des Erfinders der Yankee Candle Company. Das schlichte Design der Kringle Kerzen gef√§llt mir aber um einiges besser. Ich hab im √\u2013sterreichischen Online Shop gleich eine gro√üe Bestellung aufgegeben, aber davon sind einige Kerzen schon als Weihnachtsgeschenke gedacht.\nHerbst und Tee geh√∂ren f√ºr mich zusammen. Ich versuche jeden Tag mindestens zwei Liter davon zu trinken. Damit es nicht langweilig wird, hab ich einen riesen Vorrat zu Hause angesammelt. Meine liebsten Sorten sind momentan Ingwer & Zitrone von Teekanne und Kusmi Tea und die Sachermischung von Haas & Haas. Wenn ihr in Wien seid, solltet ihr unbedingt im Shop von Haas & Haas am Stephansplatz vorbei schauen, es gibt eine gro√üe Auswahl und ich k√∂nnte dort stundenlang st√∂bern.\nMeine Lieblingsserie momentan ist Devious Maids, sie erinnert ein bisschen an Desperate Housewives!\nWas geh√∂rt f√ºr euch im Herbst einfach dazu?\nKommentare:\n1. November 2014 um 19:35\nIngwer-Zitrone-Tee geh√∂rt auch zu meinen Lieblingen ;-) Und der \"Anastasia\"-Tee von Kusmi-Tee schmeckt wirklich toll!\nF√ºr mich geh√∂rt zum Herbst ein kuschliger Schal, neue Folgen \"thegoodwife\" und die Museumsnacht in meiner Heimatstadt.\nLg, Cath√©rine\n","title_lev":0.5142857142857142,"text_jar":0.79,"text_cosine":0.888379234586976,"url":"http:\/\/kates-fashionblog.blogspot.com\/2014\/11\/herbst-favoriten-2.html"}

A large wrap around, alderwood bar, a magazine news stand flanking the back (loaded with lots of foreign magazine goodness), an entire staff whose accents lilt with that certain French†je ne sais quoi, and loads of little dimly lit corners, perfect for tucking away and enjoying some close conversation over wine.

{"title":"Bathroom Organization Ideas - MichellePhan.com ‚\u20AC\u201C MichellePhan.com","text":"November 4, 2011 Michelle Phan\nThis Sunday marks the end of Daylight Savings Time, which means most of us will be given an extra hour this weekend to do whatever we want! Growing up, this extra hour was never wasted; most of the time, it was spent helping out with family chores or cleaning up and organizing around the house. While I can\u2019t force you to do these things on Sunday (I\u2019m not your parent, I can\u2019t make you), I would encourage you to make the most out of this hour and have an extra productive day! Do something that you would normally put off, or something that isn\u2019t really a priority but would be nice to get to at some point.\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, bathroom organization is something that definitely falls into this category. My bathroom could always use a little cleaning up ‚\u20AC\u201C not in the sense that it\u2019s dirty, but in the sense that it tends to get a little cluttered\u2026products tend to accumulate, cabinets fill up, and blow dryers get tossed aside in a hurry out the door. And don\u2019t even get me started on the mountains of makeup : \/\nSo, my challenge for you is this: Make the place where you get beautiful more beautiful, and do a little bathroom organization this weekend.\nIt can be hard to know where to start with organization projects, but here are some easy things you can do to clean out your bathroom and maximize your space.\n1. Get rid of your old makeup. Here are some guidelines for knowing when it\u2019s time to toss it.\n2. The backs of cabinet doors are organization gold: hang things, store tools, add jars or hooks, adhere a magnetic strip to keep pins in one place\u2026the opportunities are endless!\n3. Don\u2019t just dump your things on the counter! Well, at least make them look good: head to a craft store or discount home store and pick up some cute jars to toss your things in. Either mix and match, or go for a more classic look with glass or metal jars. You can also use pretty bowls and plates to hold any jewelry you wear on the reg. It will look tidier and more thoughtful!\n4. Nail polish storage can actually be very pretty too. Keep your polishes in a giant clear glass jar ‚\u20AC\u201C no more hiding them in a basket under the sink!\n5. Clean. Your. Brushes. You have the time! ( Click here for my ultimate brush cleaner.)\n6. Organize your go-to makeup. Acrylic trays are great compartmentalizers. You can either buy something like this from IKEA that\u2019s specifically for cosmetics, or get inexpensive desk organizers from any organization or super store. This is a great way to store your everyday makeup but also keep it readily accessible.\nThere are so many ways you can clean up and prettify a bathroom, but those are just a few. Getting ready in a neat and tidy area will make you feel so much more zen, especially if you have to share a bathroom!\nLet me know if you try any of these methods out! And please share your own helpful organization tricks in the comments section below\u2026I just might feature them in a future blog!\n","title_lev":0.9508196721311475,"text_jar":0.86,"text_cosine":0.9960420174438794,"url":"http:\/\/michellephan.com\/the-weekend-bathroom-challenge\/"}

{"title":"5 Beauty Products That Are Worth The Splurge - MichellePhan.com ‚\u20AC\u201C MichellePhan.com","text":"June 17, 2015 Michelle Phan\nThe price we‚\u20ACôre willing to pay for beauty can vary a great deal. You can be wiling to pay an arm and a leg for practical beauty tools or stand firm that drugstore brands get the job done. With so many options it isn‚\u20ACôt hard to see why people test out the most buzzed about products no matter the price tag. When it comes to buying there are a few rules I follow, but in general if it has solid reviews, contains quality ingredients and applies well, I‚\u20ACôm in.\nI‚\u20ACôve tried hundreds of products‚\u20AC\u201Cmany that have blown my mind‚\u20AC\u201Cbut today I wanted to feature 5 of those that no matter what, they‚\u20ACôre worth the splurge.\n1. Rm DNA Renewal DNA Sheer Defense \u2013 Wearing SPF on your face should be a no brainer at this point, but it‚\u20ACôs rare that we think about that protection as a way to help collagen growth as well. DNA Renewal is part of a circle of products emerging that not only act as a light BB Cream with 50+ SPF, but also works to repair existing sun damage with enzymes and vitamins. You could save your money and stick with a 30 SPF face lotion or you can go big to fight cellular damage, even out your skins tone and texture, and be confident that you‚\u20ACôll have all-day coverage without a high shine, oily finish.\n2. La Mer The Lip Balm - La Mer as a brand is no joke. I‚\u20ACôve been using their Creme de la Mer for ages, so it‚\u20ACôs not surprising that their a celeb and overall cult fave despite the jaw dropping fee. The Lip Balm is no different. Containing the brand‚\u20ACôs mystery Miracle Broth the balm goes on sheer while moisturizing and restoring your lips texture. Since the skin on our lips is one of the most sensitive, and easily affected by the elements, it‚\u20ACôs important to take great care of them. If you‚\u20ACôve ever used a balm that had your lips thirsting for another application, you know that you can become dependent on a product. With La Mer that won‚\u20ACôt happen, but you‚\u20ACôll want to apply it when necessary for a silky smooth, mega hydrated pout. And if you can‚\u20ACôt justify using it for only your lips, luckily there are plenty of other uses for lip balm .\n3. MAC Cosmetics Penultimate Eye Liner - There are a lot of formulas to use and ways to apply your eyeliner . One that always seems like an easy solution, even for the makeup novice, is a liquid marker-like liner. However most, especially those with more affordable price tags, rarely deliver the color results desired and tend to go on more watery and require more effort than your pencil, cream or typical liquid liner. But when you find the right one, these pen style liners offer precision application and major color payoff. That‚\u20ACôs why the MAC Penultimate Liner is a must. Along with the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Liner , these liners dress up your eyes and go on flawlessly.\n4. NCLA Nail Lacquers \u2013 It can be hard to justify paying $16 for nail polish, especially when we change our polish as quickly as our minds. But between all the brands on the market and color options available, sometimes there seems to be a lack of new, original hues to polish on. That‚\u20ACôs where NCLA kills it and is worth every penny. While there are crazy neon colors (which aren‚\u20ACôt true neons btw) from cheaper brands, there just isn‚\u20ACôt that same confetti meets summer vibe meets ‚\u20ACúOh You Say You Have Nail Wraps too!‚\u20AC? like NCLA offers. Their creamy lacquers are made right here in California and are 5-free . And their holographic line‚\u20AC¶need I say more!¬†\n5. AmorePacific Color Control Cushion Compact \u2013 Cushion compacts were one of the most buzzed about beauty products last year and for good reason. Just like MAC‚\u20ACôs eye liner, you have a lot of options when it comes to foundation application, but what makes the AmorePacific Cushion Compact worth the $60 splurge is that it‚\u20ACôs basically 3 beauty products rolled into one. The coverage is unbelievable, the cushion applicator allows you to build your product up for light to heavy coverage days, the cushion also provides a streak-free finish (no brushes required) and it touts SPF 50. What better way to protect your face and get an even complexion?\nIs there a beauty product you‚\u20ACôre willing to pay a pretty penny for? Let me know below!\n<3 Mish\n","title_lev":0.4931506849315068,"text_jar":0.84,"text_cosine":0.9811803756433366,"url":"http:\/\/michellephan.com\/5-beauty-products-that-are-worth-the-splurge\/"}

Things such as a slightly lopsided vase, a shirt that\u2019s missing a button, or an old, wooden desk that\u2019s a little too dry. It\u2019s believed that by recognizing the beauty in such things, we can better appreciate the natural cycle of life \u2013 from growth to decay to eventually death.†\nJonathan Lukacek \u2013 the very talented blogger behind Bandanna Almanac \u2013 is certainly familiar with the concept. He\u2019s an American living in Japan, having stayed there after studying abroad for college. He\u2019s also an†inveterate thrifter who likes to collect garments with a lot character (rather than things that happen to be rare or hold value). In other words, \u201Cthings that tell a story,\u201D as he put it to me.†\nSeen above are some of the creative ways he\u2019s repaired his vintage finds. There\u2019s a pair of jeans with pocket bags made from cut-up bandannas; a dirty collar of a denim shirt made new again through some more bandanna cloth; an old Five Brothers flannel with a slightly askew internal pocket (made with just the right amount of pattern matching); a denim jacket with blanket lining on the outside of the coat; and finally, some decorative sashiko stitching on the collar of an old chambray shirt.†\nEverything was done with fabrics that Jonathan has either thrifted or found over the years. Some repairs he did himself; others he did in collaboration with his good friend Narita at Brown Tabby (a vintage repair shop in Japan). All of it is awesome \u2013 especially if you\u2019ve ever appreciated anything at a thrift store or flea market, or even the designer lines that are inspired by such things (e.g. Blue Blue Japan , Kapital , and Visvim ).†\nYou can see more of Jonathan\u2019s work at his Instagram account. He also occasionally sells things at† Etsy and eBay .†\n","title_lev":0.6470588235294118,"text_jar":0.83,"text_cosine":0.9798599943709542,"url":"http:\/\/putthison.com\/post\/106520737133\/a-little-diy-wabi-sabi-whereas-most-of-us-value"}

{"title":"Put This On \u2022 Fragrances, Part Two: How to Choose Something for...","text":"A blog about dressing like a grownup\nJuly 24, 2014\nFragrances, Part Two: How to Choose Something for Yourself\nIn some ways, choosing a fragrance is straightforward: you pick something you\u2019d want to wear. At the same time, there\u2019s more to it than just sniffing the bottle.\nThe first thing you need to know is that fragrances react to your body and evolve over time. So when you\u2019re out shopping for a scent, only use the blotter strips to see what you\u2019d like to sample, and then spray no more than one scent per wrist. That way, your nose won\u2019t be confused. As you wear those scents throughout the day, pay attention to how they change. Scents are described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of notes, which make up a harmonious scent accord. These notes are released over time:\nTop notes: Also known as the head notes, these are what you smell†upon immediate application. Top notes are very strong and assertive, and often a bit citrusy. I find them to be too strong when I\u2019m in public, so I apply scents about five minutes before going outside. A scent\u2019s top notes will have evaporated by then.†\nMiddle notes:†Next are the middle notes, which typically last for about thirty minutes. Middle notes form the heart of a fragrance, and are usually much more well-rounded and mellow.†\nBasenotes: A fragrance\u2019s middle notes and basenotes form the real \u201Ctheme\u201D of a fragrance, which is why you need to give it time before you judge it. Basenotes start to come out after the first thirty minutes and will last until the scent†disappears.†\nIn addition to paying attention to how something evolves, think about what you\u2019re smelling and whether those scents are suitable for your needs. Things that smell very citrusy, floral, green, or aquatic, for example, might only be good for daytime use, or for the spring and summer seasons. Conversely, things that smell more like wood, amber, vanilla, or leather might be better for nighttime use, or for the fall and winter seasons. Whether something is right for you is as much about when you plan to wear it as it is about your personality. †\nOnce you\u2019ve picked something, the rest is easy.\nStoring: Fragrances are sensitive to light and heat, so store things in cool and dry places, and away from direct sunlight. On top your dresser is fine; on the dashboard of your car is not.\nApplication: Generally speaking, you want to spray fragrances about 3-6 inches away from your body, and directly on pulse points (so neck, inner elbow, or wrist). Remember, fragrances need to react to your body, so don\u2019t apply scents to your clothes. I personally spray stuff on my wrist, and then lightly dab my wrists on my neck. (Rubbing is bad for the oils). Whatever you do, don\u2019t spray fragrances into the air and walk through the mist. That does little more than freshen up the room. †\nAmount: How much you apply is personal, and will depend on the strength of what you\u2019re spraying. Some things require a bit more application; some things less. Obviously: when in doubt, always err on the side of caution. If you want something to last long, just get a longer lasting scent, rather than go wild with a weak one.†\nFinally, if you want to try out a new scent, or just develop your nose, buy samplers before you buy bottles. Doing so can be a nice way to check things out without dropping too much money. The Perfumed Court is a popular online source, and you can do a Google search for†\u201Cfragrance decants.\u201C You can also find good reviews at Basenotes , where there\u2019s a large online community of enthusiasts.\n","title_lev":0.32727272727272727,"text_jar":0.83,"text_cosine":0.9916209947080747,"url":"http:\/\/putthison.com\/post\/92737782465\/fragrances-part-two-how-to-choose-something-for"}

{"title":"She Wears Fashion - UK Fashion blog: We're gonna let it burn.","text":"Wednesday, 21 August 2013\nWe're gonna let it burn.\nA while ago I was asked if I'd like to style up a lovely dress from Gorgeous Couture as part of their 'Blogger Edit' and I couldn't help but see this as a challenge. I don't tend to wear lots of girly dresses on the blog (I want to start doing more evening wear stuff though so watch this space!) so I decided I would work this dress in a very 'shewearsfashion' way.\nSo basically throwing a cap on yeah.\nWhite Large Leather Rucksack, c\/o Grafea\nNah I'm joking! I LOVE the cut out details on this dress they are so sexy without being over the top! Working this 'down' was quite difficult but I think I did okay! I love the mix with these shoes cap and rucksack - and that they're all white so it fits with the monochrome trend quite nicely!\nThe dress is also crazy flattering it made me look like I had curves aswell which is amazing as I have a very boyish shape!\nHope you are all good! Again very busy but happy :-)\n","title_lev":0.94,"text_jar":0.77,"text_cosine":0.9371730162857819,"url":"http:\/\/www.shewearsfashion.com\/2013\/08\/were-gonna-let-it-burn.html"}
