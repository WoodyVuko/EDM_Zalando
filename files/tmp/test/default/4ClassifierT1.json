{"title":"And I Get Dressed: Review: Palihouse, West Hollywood","text":"April 29, 2015\nReview: Palihouse, West Hollywood\nOf all the places I travel for work or for pleasure, I'm in Los Angeles the most. It's funny, when you visit a place fairly regularly - you get into a routine. You stay at the same hotels, eat at the same places. Often, I can spend my entire 2-3 days in a square mile radius!\nThis trip, I knew I wanted a different experience. I'd venture out and stay at a hotel I've never been to and go for more of that home away from home feeling. I'd heard great things about Pali House - there's one in West Hollywood (where I stayed) and one in Santa Monica - so I figured I'd give it a try. I love boutique hotels with a bit of whimsey. The first photo is the view walking into the door. I was greeted by a very friendly front desk clerk who took my luggage down the stairs. Check it was easy and the elevator to the rooms are through this charming courtyard restaurant.\nI stayed in the Studio Residence which is basically a studio loft apartment that most New Yorkers would kill for. It's spacious, open and has a full kitchen. I didn't do any cooking in the three days I was here but the full size fridge was fab to have since I had guests over one day. The large marble bathroom is gorgeous - a little dark so no photos sorry!\nYou can check out the open floor plan here. Quite a large room and the sectional sofa can double as a spare bed. The glass door leads to patio, featured below. All in all a terrific hotel I would definitely stay again. Just don't take outfit photos in the courtyard outside your room - \"photo-shoots\" are apparently, a thing...\nBoyfriend Nightshirt *that I totally wore as clothes c\/o Simply Be, Kari Patent Sandals c\/o Long Tall Sally\nPhotos of me, Jessica Castro\nCurrently Coveting\n","title_lev":0.3333333333333333,"text_jar":0.84,"text_cosine":0.9866611561005342,"url":"http:\/\/www.andigetdressed.com\/2015\/04\/review-palihouse-west-hollywood.html"}
