{"title":"GarnerStyle | The Curvy Girl Guide: My $12 Dress","text":"Saturday, June 6, 2015\nMy $12 Dress\nTime for another bargain hunting post.  One of my favorite and most comfortable summer time looks is pairing a lightweight summer dress with nylon leggings, what's even better is I got them are amazing prices at Ross Dress for Less .  The dress was $12, the hat was $11, the bag was $40, and the necklace was $17, totaling $80! I also love this look because it allows me to be shapewear free, which is super important in the summer, and it also allows me to wear dresses that are shorter.  I've never been a fan of my legs, but it always seems like the cute dress are too short for my comfort zone.  I paired the dress with leggings and I'm cute and in my comfort zone. Win! \nStyle Notes: This dress was purchased within a week of this post, so for those looking for it there is a pretty good chance that it still there.  I purchased in a size 3x. There is no stretch.  \nDress, Bag, Hat, Necklace - Ross , Shoes - Lane Bryant, Lip - Milani \"Sweet Nectar\"\nThis post was sponsored by Ross, all opinions are my own. \n","title_lev":0.75,"text_jar":0.86,"text_cosine":0.9645547991632513,"url":"http:\/\/garnerstyle.blogspot.com\/2015\/06\/plus-size-summer-outfits.html"}
