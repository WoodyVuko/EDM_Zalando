{"title":"Camille Over the Rainbow: Beach Waves","text":"Ph. Renzo Franco\nBeen back barely a week from the U S of A\u2014strictly speaking; have already relocated to Copenhagen for the long weekend\u2014but it looks like I have fully caught the LA bug. \nSeasoned Cali-callers had warned me, but you see I thought I was safe. No one could come between me and my great love, The Big Apple . The City of Angels and I, surely, would never see eye to eye. My mind was made up before I even touched-down at LAX. And this despite years spent religiously stalking the lives of Lauren Conrad and co via MTV (and loving every minute of it). \nToo spread-out. Too much of an empty shell. Too flashy. \nToo good to be true. \nTwo days, two hours on the phone with American Airlines, and a return flight back to London extended by two-weeks later, I'm a convert. From Abbot Kinney's unrivalled food spots, to Santa Monica's tropical sunset-kissed pier, to West Hollywood's easy, breezy way of life and Silverlake's quirky settings and hipster-ish vibes, not an adventure went awry*. \nI'm already plotting my return.\n* All but one . But that is another tale altogether. \n \n","title_lev":0.9375,"text_jar":0.83,"text_cosine":0.9405136888811234,"url":"http:\/\/www.camilleovertherainbow.com\/2014\/05\/beach-waves.html"}
