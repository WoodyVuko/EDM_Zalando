{"title":"ModCloth Plus Sizes | Gabifresh","text":"June 18, 2013\nModCloth Plus Sizes\nLast week I went to ModCloth\u2019s plus size launch event, and I can\u2019t tell you how refreshing it was to hear from a team 100% committed to making great plus size clothing. Though they\u2019ve offered plus sizes for a while now, they acknowledged the need to make things better and have spent the past year researching what plus size women want and perfecting fit issues. If you\u2019ve had problems with their size chart in the past, know that they have revamped everything and starting now, their plus items should fit much more true to size.  They\u2019re totally open to constant improvement, welcome feedback, and encourage women to share reviews, pictures, and information on how each item fits. Make sure you check out their site if you haven\u2019t lately!\nI wore a Dorothy Perkins blazer (on sale here ), Forever21 jeans and top, and Aldo heels:\n \n \n(I did cut my hair, but not that much! It\u2019s pinned back.)\nPS- For those of you that loved the ASOS Maternity swing dress I wore recently, they just added it to the Curve collection, but it\u2019s already sold out in white! Black is available here . \n","title_lev":0.8518518518518519,"text_jar":0.85,"text_cosine":0.9745134780773812,"url":"\/\/gabifresh.com\/2013\/06\/modcloth-plus-sizes\/"}
