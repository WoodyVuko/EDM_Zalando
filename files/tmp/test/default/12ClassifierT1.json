Almost to the point where you could liken it to a West Side Story rivalry -- we literally choose sides. Friendships can be forged because of it. Relationships can be ruined because of it. And while I'll save my roundup of favorite roasts and coffee shops for a later post (coming next week), I wanted to share this gem of mine, Cafe de la Presse , a little bistro + cafe nestled in the Union Square\/downtown area. \n Granted, it can get pretty touristy in and around this area, but what I love the most about Cafe de la Presse is its ability to make you forget all about that. Their outdoor patio has the right amount of greenery and potted bushes around it to enclose the space and the ambiance inside is unbeatable. A large wrap around, alderwood bar, a magazine news stand flanking the back (loaded with lots of foreign magazine goodness), an entire staff whose accents lilt with that certain French je ne sais quoi, and loads of little dimly lit corners, perfect for tucking away and enjoying some close conversation over wine. It's a little bit of 1930s Paris, right there in Union Square. And I'm certainly going to miss it.\nI'm saying goodbye to San Francisco!
