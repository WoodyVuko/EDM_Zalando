{"title":"Maxi « Gary Pepper","text":"Gary Pepper Vintage\nJust a sneak peek of some the amazing vintage maxi dresses and cute little party frocks hitting the store tonight and over the weekend. I am so pleased to have finally been able to take photos of this special collection as theyâ\u20AC™ve been quietly waiting their turn for nearly 6 months in my office. All handpicked for their breathtaking, interesting and one of a kind qualities from private sellers across the globe, with a large majority of these being sourced straight from the UK, I am hoping these statement dresses will play a large part in your wardrobes for years to come and perhaps something youâ\u20AC™ll never let go. Particular favorites are the coral full bead embellished maxi, the black full pleated maxi and all of the cute little evening dresses pictured below, especially the gold bead embellished dress with a cut out back. So amazing. Iâ\u20AC™ve never seen vintage dresses quite like this before so i hope you all enjoy them as much as i do! It really is so hard to see them go\u2026\n","title_lev":0.9333333333333333,"text_jar":0.83,"text_cosine":0.9848101265822785,"url":"http:\/\/garypeppergirl.com\/2011\/03\/m-a-x-i-h-e-a-r-t-s"}
