Just a faint little tinge that makes us wonder \u201Cis it? isn\u2019t it\u201D\nhttps:\/\/serenacarranza.wordpress.com\/ Serena C\nI\u2019ve been wanting this ever since (im not going to lie) Kylie Jenner had her hair similar to this.  This looks so good on you. Xo\nhttp:\/\/www.prudencepetitestyle.wordpress.com\/ Prudence Yeo\nCool navy blue hair and the dress looks amazing on you!\nPrudence\nhttp:\/\/www.prudencepetitestyle.com\nGuest\nLol it looks like you\u2019re taking your dead fox out for a walk lmao. Like do you hold it for the sake of photos to create a certain \u201Cvibe\u201D or do you really carry along as an accessory? Either way it looks stupid imo.\nhttp:\/\/www.NikkisHaven.com\/ Nikki\u2019s Haven\nLove the color blue on you! also loving that dress! Werk girl!\nxoxo Nikki\nhttp:\/\/www.itsaboutla.fr\/ It\u2019s About L.A\nThat looks very great on you!\nL.A\nhttp:\/\/www.itsaboutla.fr\/\nWhitney V\nCouldn\u2019t agree more!  Life\u2019s too short for boring hair and that\u2019s why I finally made the decision to cut it as well, at the end of the day, it\u2019s just hair and it grows!!  So it\u2019s all good!  And I\u2019m loving the blue gradient on you\u2026 x\nLove,\n","title_lev":0.5909090909090909,"text_jar":0.59,"text_cosine":0.40771958535475356,"url":"http:\/\/karlascloset.com\/blueberry\/"}
