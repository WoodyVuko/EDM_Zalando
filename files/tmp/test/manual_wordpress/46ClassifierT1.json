These crocodile print embossed waxed jeans arrived two days ago from Rich & Skinny\u2013thank you so much Samantha! I am in love with them! These patent bondage wedges are Givenchy from a few years ago\u2026a lucky find on Yoox. They feel like boulders on my feet, at least I'm super anchored to the ground so there is less of a chance that  will fall on my face.\nWe have had such sad weather this week. It is grey and dreery and the last of the leaves are falling. I wish I could get under a blanket and put on The Thin Man.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\t\n\t\n\t\tLike  |  \n\t\tTweet  |  \n\t\tPermalink  |  \n\t\tNo Comments\t\n","title_lev":1.0,"text_jar":0.79,"text_cosine":0.9593508129463826,"url":"http:\/\/www.seaofshoes.com\/sea_of_shoes\/2011\/11\/oversized.html"}
