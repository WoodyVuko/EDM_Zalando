I wash them in cold and sometime toss them in the dryer or line dry them. I say \u201Cthem\u201D because I\u2019ve done it to 3 now. All with awesome results. I love the way they hang and clearly don\u2019t need them for warmth or to button up but are perfect for work. \u2026last seen here {I clearly wear this one the most \u2026but here\u2019s the navy one paired with a dress I just saw Eva Longoria wearing recently actually {and from when I used my iMac to shoot my photos & at work, hilarious!}* White cutout\/lace trim skirt \u2026from a local Farmer\u2019s Market a couple years ago. Tag says HiBiS Lace Works \u2013 Van Couver | Los Angeles \u2026last seen here {wow, these old outfit posts are like a time machine. It takes a while to get you\u2019re photos right \u2026and I\u2019m sure in another year, I\u2019ll say the same about these}* Vintage belt \u2026I would have actually preferred this rad belt from ASOS {which I just bought} seen on Smile yesterday because I\u2019m not 100% loving the one I\u2019m wearing but it was the closest match* L.A.M.B. studded sandals from GILT I absolutely love these heels but they are a bit high even for me \u2026though if my ankle weren\u2019t in need of a doctor\u2019s visit, I\u2019d be fine but since it\u2019s so swollen, it\u2019s hard for me to arch it right \u2026I know, I know \u2026I\u2019m making doctor rounds * Rachel Roy gold drop earrings \u2026love these* Tom Ford Sunglasses \u2013 Anouk* Louis Vuitton Speedy 30 bag* Hair: waved {see video \u2026no don\u2019t, I need to make a new one} \u2026and clipped with the perfect tiny hair clips \u2026close up here & later after I changed, lol* Title : from Katy Perry \u201CWho Am I Living For\u201D \u2026I obviously am addicted to Katy Perry\u2019s new album. It\u2019s really fantastic. \nOf course as soon as I stepped outside to shoot a few outfit pics, the wind picked up and not only blew my hair directly into my lip gloss but puffed my blouse up like a loaf of baking bread. Awesome. \nA word {or paragraph} about yesterdays post : I promised myself I would never apologize for my blog because well, it\u2019s mine and if you aren\u2019t interested then don\u2019t come here  BUT I do want to express a little sorry for my sad post yesterday. Sometimes it just hits like a ton of bricks and yes, I am lucky in so many ways and yes things could be worse and no I\u2019d rather not blather on and on {for years} about how I can\u2019t get pregnant but I do so again and again, thank you for listening. I\u2019ve also noticed when I\u2019m in that little baby funk that my DIYs seem to disappear. Funny thing, sadness, zapping me of my creativity & motivation. Bah I say! But I\u2019ve got a few ideas that I\u2019ll get to work on and share with you very soon  I\u2019ve also been putting off a hair video for about a month now.

Those of us who have faced infertility TOTALLY get it. It\u2019s a process to deal with this. In my case, learning that we would never have a bio child was a HUGE grieving process. Four years later, it\u2019s still painful. I have made my choice, we\u2019ve moved on and I am at peace. But it will always be a source of sadness .. and that\u2019s NORMAL! take the time you need to deal!\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSadie's Momma \nSeptember 1, 2010 | Reply\n\n\n \n\n\n\nI think of you often and wonder what\u2019s going on in your gorgeous head.

You want a child, you\u2019re prepared for a child, and then you can\u2019t seem to have one. That would bum anyone out. I hope you get what you want, and if you can\u2019t get pregnant, that you adopt a kid from one of the 16 and pregnant girls.

I know exactly how you feel, because I feel the exact same way. My husband & I are also dealing with infertility (we both have issues, awesome.) and have no interest in IVF, either. As you pointed out, the process of sifting through your emotions is all part of the process. Thank you for being so honest. I appreciate knowing that someone else feels exactly the same way that I do. Hang in there, girl.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAnonymous \nSeptember 1, 2010 | Reply\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHi Maegan, I agree with Emily, apology definitely not necessary, it\u2019s YOUR Blog and you can write anything you want anytime you feel like it. I am 31 years old, so you are not that older than I am, and an planning to try getting pregnant soon, I have polycistic ovaries (don\u2019t know if i wrote it ok), so I am of course nervous about not being able to get pregnant anytime soon, but I would definetly would consider any medication if needed. Sorry if I am being too nosy, but I was wondering If you want to get pregnant so hard, why won\u2019t you try modern methods? have you been like actually diagnosed as infertile, or what have been your gynecologyst\u2019s recommendations so far? You and your husband make a great couple, you would be such amazing parents\u2026. deep from my heart I hope you get to be a mom anytime soon.

So many fabulous bloggers post the pictures and that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s fine and that has its own merits but what I love in a blog is to see how personality interacts with clothing and creates a style and a life. And personality isn\u2019t just happiness, sometimes it\u2019s sadness too. And all of that adds up to you, which is why I come back here. So, no worries about posting whatever you want. And damn straight, it is your blog\u2013you can do whatever you want with it.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKatie \nSeptember 1, 2010 | Reply\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLove those earrings!\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGmr \nSeptember 1, 2010 | Reply\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOMG the heels!!

You have a beautiful heart!!\nxoxo J\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSTYLEEZTA \nSeptember 4, 2010 | Reply\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLoving this outfit!!\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDa Fashionista \nSeptember 5, 2010 | Reply\n\n\n \n\n\n\ngorgeous. think my favorite one of yours yet. kiss.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNadine \nSeptember 5, 2010 | Reply\n\n\n \n\n\n\nI love your style AND your honesty.\n\n\n\n \n\n\napparellel \nSeptember 7, 2010 | Reply\n\n\n \n\n\n\ni think one of the healthiest things you can do for you is express yourself, and there is a lot of power that comes with putting those words down on paper (computer). and fuck anyone who would judge you for that. \ni felt such sadness when i read your last post. i am such an empath and feel others pain so strongly. one of the hardest parts of living in los angeles for me. anyway i believe that your dreams will come true. i don\u2019t know why we have these tests or whatever but so much of it is about timing i\u2019ve found. \nand as for the sadness and not being inspired i totally understand. i have been suffering with chronic depression for 10 years and it\u2019s been so bad the past few months that i can\u2019t even think of doing a diy let alone hardly walk my dog. i hope you feel well soon and just want you to know that i am sending you a lot of positive energy.\nxxxt\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply \n\nClick here to cancel reply. \n\n\n Cancel reply\n\nName * \nEmail * \nWebsite \nComment  \n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n    \ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1426538424674-1'); });\n\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1429802290020-0'); });\n  \n\n LATEST POSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDIY Gold Branch Hair Pins \/\/ Faux Golden Hair Twigs\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI Wanna Make You Mine, Won\u2019t You Lay It On the Line\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWeekly Instagram Recap \/\/ June 7-14 in Photos\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArt \/\/ Form \/\/ Strength \/\/ Body \/\/ Beauty \/\/ Ballet\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBluma \/\/ A New Way to Carry Your FRESH BLOOMS & Flowers\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecipe \/\/ Blueberry Ricotta Lemon Almond Muffins\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIs It Too Much To Ask For Something Great\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nParty Planning Made Easy\u2026 Mrs. Peasy Rents Tablewares in a Box!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOPI Infinite Shine Playful Nail Art Manicure\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWeekly Instagram Photo Recap \/\/ 6\/1-6\/7 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBeauty \/\/ Rose Byrne x Violet Grey\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJune Gloom Refresh \/\/ Summer style with ROSS\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLast Chance to Get 15% Off The Shelby Dress!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlant These to Help Save The Bees\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBuy The Shelby Dress & Join The Shelby Clan\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2018Marilyn in Bed\u2019 \/\/ A Photography Project\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWeekly Instagram Photo Recap \/\/ 5\/24-5\/31 2015\n\n\n \nDIY Archives \nsponsor \u2013 blogad <!--\ngoogle_ad_client = \"ca-pub-6389125474749973\";\n\/* New SideBar, created 3\/19\/10 *\/\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"8598356353\";\ngoogle_ad_width = 160;\ngoogle_ad_height = 600;\n\/\/-->\n<!--\ngoogle_ad_client = \"ca-pub-6389125474749973\";\n\/* New SideBar, created 3\/19\/10 *\/\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"8598356353\";\ngoogle_ad_width = 160;\ngoogle_ad_height = 600;\n\/\/-->\n\n  \n  \n \n  medianet_width='160';  medianet_height= '600';  medianet_crid='755575843';   \n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nFast Free Shipping Worldwide \n\nShopbop.com\n\n\n\nJUST ARRIVED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRacer Back Tank Top by Raquel Allegra \n\n\nView\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy Leather Flats from Maison Martin Margiela \n\n\nView\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPierce Slip On Sneakers fashion \n\n\nView\n\n\n\n\n\n<\n>\n\n\n\n\nSHOP BELTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy Now at Shopbop \n\n\nView\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMadewell Collection \n\n\nView\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaison Martin Margiela Multi Leather Belt \n\n\nView\n\n\n\n\n\n<\n>\n\n\n\n\nFEATURED\n\n\n+1 \n\nGet this widget \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \/**\n     * Sets the global variable to pass the\n     * *\/\n     var shopbopProductVaribles = {\"affOption\":\"nothanks\",\"cjPid\":\"null\",\"cjAid\":\"11585200\"};\nLatest on Instagram  Follow @lovemaegan on Instagram ?\n\n\nFrom Around the Web...\n\n\n   \n \n \n","title_lev":1.0,"text_jar":0.56,"text_cosine":0.7525686508580556,"url":"http:\/\/www.lovemaegan.com\/2010\/09\/i-am-ready-for-the-road-less-traveled.html"}
