Â How I\u2019ve missed trampling up damp smelling staircases to get to concrete bunker roomsÂ where I get sploshed about with beer. Â It\u2019s back down to earth after my far-and-away otherworldly jaunts to Palm Springs and Cannes but with Donatella Versace leading the proceedings, it was never really going to be yer\u2019 average event.\nLast night saw the first VersusÂ collection presented by Anthony Vaccarello, after his appointment as permanent creative director of the line, at a #VersusCalling event in London. Â When Versus was entrusted toÂ Donatella by brother Gianni in the nineties, she was keen to kick things up a notch with by injectingÂ a young and clubby spirit with party-slash-gig-slash-presentations. Â The recent reboot phase of Versus has followed in more or less the same line. Â The event last night was termed aÂ \u201Chappening\u201D and with an emphasis now on the e-commerce, this collection is the first to adhere to Donatella\u2019s \u2018â\u20AC˜See Now-Buy Now-Wear Nowâ\u20AC™ concept as most of the pieces are available to buy straight away.\n\n\n\nAnd so we went up those familiarÂ dank stairs of the Old Truman Brewery festooned with #VersaceCalling tape to catch the skyline of London disappearing into darkness. Â Under shelter from the appropriately drizzlyÂ skies, the latest campaign images shot by Collier Schorr and styled by Alastair McKimm were projected onto the walls, with the intermittent playing of a choppy short film by Natalie Canguilhem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDonatella and Anthony held court over performances by upcoming bands Nothing But Thieves and Zibra (picked out by Donatella\u2019s son apparently) with the likes of Maisie Williams and Jaimie Winstone in the crowd to mosh away with the pair. Â Well actually, knowing Anthony, he was more of a stoic observer whilst on the other hand, Â Donatella waved hands like she just didn\u2019t care. Â In my beer-friendly plaid shirt and kilt and flat Versus \u201Cbovver\u201D boots complete with safety pin hardware, IÂ was also happy to be back in my natural habitat.\n\n\n\nNothing But Thieves\nZibra performing on stage\nRoman Kemp DJ-ing\n\n\n\nMaisie Williams \u2013 line of the night was \u201COh my god \u2013 she\u2019s not a child! Â She has boobs!\u201D\nWearing Versus plaid shirt and asymmetric kiltÂ from the new collection\nHardwareÂ ready to pound concrete with new season Versus boots and Versus safety pin bracelet and leather cuffÂ \nWith my \u2018bro\u2019 Adam Chinese Symbol\nWhilst the primary reference of this latestÂ collection was the lithe Brett Anderson in his Suede heyday, Vaccarello\u2019s treatment of his own Versus references \u2013 primarily the campaign imagery shot by Bruce Weber in the nineties \u2013 have continued to yield piecesÂ that resurrect that yesteryear Versus spirit. Â For this see-it-buy-it-wear-it collection, Stella Tennant flanked by rugged redhead ladsÂ in Scottish tartan from a 1995 campaign made its presence be known with asymmetric kilts (for guys and girls), plaid sweaters and perfectly proportioned shirts that can be semi-tucked in and out. Â The black dresses of Vaccarello\u2019sÂ first outing for Versus also reappear with askant hemlines and Versace lion\u2019s head continues to rear its head in the silver hardware. Â The \u201Chappening\u201DÂ may have been in London but the appeal of Vaccarello\u2019s Versus revival certainly goes far and beyond the big smoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t8 Comments »\n\t\t\t\tPosted by susie on 15\/05\/15 | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=\/^http:\/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+':\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","title_lev":0.15384615384615385,"text_jar":0.88,"text_cosine":0.9765571166352219,"url":"http:\/\/stylebubble.co.uk\/style_bubble\/2015\/05\/versus-calling.html"}
