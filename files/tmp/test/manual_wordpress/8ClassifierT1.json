They can be a bit misleading. When I see sunshine, Iâ\u20AC™m pre-programmed to break out the shorts, which is fine while in the sun, but as soon as a breeze picks up or I find myself in the shade, I\u2019m afraid I might freeze to death. So of course, Queenie pulled the gentleman card and lent me his All Saints jacket which made an interesting prop while we shot.\nI often find using borrowed things a bittersweet experience. The idea of wearing something that doesnâ\u20AC™t belong to you is always thrilling, however, the pleasure is fleeting because you always, always, have to give it back. \n\n\nClick click click!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\non Me: Queenie\u2019s All Saints jacket, camouflage shirt and camouflage shorts by Fox Pixel by Paul B, sweater by Belstaff, sunglasses by Michael Kors\non Queenie: sunglasses by Rayban, jacket, cardigan and shorts by All Saints, top by Uniqlo\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\tFebruary 26, 2013\n\t\t\t\u2014\n\t\t\n\t\t\tcomments 18\t\t\n\t\n\t\tUncategorized\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPermalink\n\t\t\n\n\t\n","title_lev":0.9411764705882353,"text_jar":0.89,"text_cosine":0.9666631972453518,"url":"http:\/\/www.bryanboy.com\/bryanboy_le_superstar_fab\/2013\/02\/pacific-beach.html"}
