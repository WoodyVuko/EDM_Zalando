But there\u20ACs one major rule that comes with the territory: you must steer clear of looking like a schoolgirl (unless, of course, you\u20ACre trying to look like a schoolgirl, but that\u20ACs a story for a different day).Ensure you don\u20ACt end up in knee socks and pigtails, and opt for this J茅r么me Dreyfuss satchel-esque backpack. With leopard-print pony hair, it\u20ACs pure city-chic. Skinny leather straps mixed up with chain details evoke a sense of luxury. Plus, the straps are removable so you can wear it like a satchel, with the handle resting in the crook of your arm. A great hidden back zip allows you to access the interior without going through the flap. With an ultimate emphasis on the awesome print, this is no-brainer cool mixed with easy function.J茅r么me Dreyfuss backpack on NET-A-PORTER for $1,140.Pair with: Go gutsy and playful by wearing this backpack with Miu Miu\u20ACs covetably cute cropped peasant top.
