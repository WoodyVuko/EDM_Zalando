It characterizes that seamless marriage of what is unarguably \u201Cchic,\u201D or maybe romantic about fashion, (see pink sleeves peeking out of a white sweater, flimsy, novel shorts and more tough belts, elegant sandals in kookier colors,) to it\u2019s coming-of-age step-sister, fun (see: the now ubiquitous Prada smoking lips held up against real lips\u2013that are not my own.) Isn\u2019t there just something magical about it all?\nAnd onto the events of Fashion\u2019s Night Out. Ah, the eve of many partnerships. Consider this an unofficial summoning to join me Thursday night at the Paige Denim boutique (71 Mercer Street,) between Spring and Broome from 6 to 7PM. We will talk about interesting things and look at ripped jeans and drink champagne and really enjoy ourselves. Following that, we will hop scotch over to Grand Central Station with Bobbi Brown where maybe, just maybe, I will learn how to apply makeup once and for all. 7 to 8. It wouldn\u2019t be the same without you there. That speaks for both events. More on this tomorrow, but: come on! Yeah!
