And because most these looks include leather, a fabric notorious for its uncanny ability to man-get (cue the sex shops,) I strongly suggest you opt to wear scissor as hands while channeling Eddie. After all, few great outfits are complete if at the end of the night you\u2019re not alone.\n\nLet\u2019s take a strut (pun fun, right here) down past runways, courtesy of Style.com: \nRick Owens rarely if ever designs a collection without channeling the queen of Darkness and last fall was no exception. The inclusion however, of heavy black eye make up and big fail whales in the form of slicked back hair-do had the models ten blades away from becoming bizarro scissorhands. Note the Seinfeld reference.\n\n See what I mean? Those gloves are begging for blades. \n\nAnd I\u2019m just throwing this in for good measure because it would be unbecoming of someone who calls herself the Man Repeller not to. Look, it\u2019s a leather hat, slash hood, slash condom, slash cape, slash fur accoutrement. \n\nHere\u2019s Rick\u2019s wife, shot by Jak&Jil;, doing Tim Burton, little black riding hood, tobacco supporters and myself proud.\n\nYou should really look into finding a new nail salon. \n\nAt Elise Overland, things were slightly more feminine:\n\n\nLooking at these images now, I question the initial Tim Burton connection I made. Sure, there are shoulder pads and leather turtlenecks, but are these repellers? Will a man weigh in? Man, WOULD YOU HAVE SEX WITH THESE WOMEN?\n\n\n\nimages via Jak&Jil;\nKate the Great, I love you so hard. You may say moto-chic, but I say Burton chic. \nAnd finally, here\u2019s me looking suicide chic and what not. I was initially holding several pairs of scissors between my finger tips but I accidentally cut a block of hair out of my head which was fairly traumatic for the events of a Thursday night at 9PM just before heading out for dinner. \n\njacket by Veda, leather pants by Topshop, sheer blouse by Dolce & Gabbana, bow booties by Opening Ceremony \nI accidentally cut my hair in the name of this blog, don\u2019t ever say I don\u2019t love you.  \nRepellows, I\u2019m sorry if you didn\u2019t laugh through the duration of this post but aside from the fact that I am now missing a small patch of hair, I am not a machine that produces infinite funny words at the drop of a ruffle. Just kidding, I am.\nAnd in honor of this chilly Friday there\u2019s one more thing I have to share with you:Winter loving turban wearers, rejoice! \n\nYesterday, fellow repellow Cecilia sent me a photo of Peter Jensen\u2019s knit turban equipped with center pom pom et al! I nearly shot myself in the leg when I signed in to order the turban and learned the $120 centerpiece was already sold out. \nAnd then, I breathed a heavy sigh of relief. Cecilia assured me the red one, that would match any gentile\u2019s Christmas decorations was still in stock.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t sure before, you should be now: \u2018Tis the season to be Man Repelling.\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t                .nrelate_related .nr_sponsored{ left:0px !important; }\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Three Ways to Look Cool at a Summer Wedding\n                    \n                    \n                                            by Leandra Medine Â· Style\n                                        \n\n                \n             \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Styling a Real Woman\n                    \n                    \n                                            by Amelia Diamond Â· Shopping\n                                        \n\n                \n             \n                        \n            \n        \n    \t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \t#pubexchange_below_content .pe-wrapper ul.pe-module li.pe-article {margin: 0px !important; width:100% !important; display:block; min-height:104px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \t.pe-editorial {text-align:left; display:block !important; }\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-headline {line-height:100% !important; padding-top:6px !important; display:block !important;font-style:normal !important; font-size:24px !important; letter-spacing:-1px;}\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-partner-name {font-size:16px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-thumb img {margin-top:0px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-thumb {margin-right:10px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \t.pe-thumb-wrapper {}\n\t\t\t\t \t.pe-partner-name {clear:both; font-style:italic !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                    \n        \n            \nhttp:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/07940604471771335136                ValeF\n            \n        \n        \n            you look very nice in that pic! but, my God, that turban, it looks like a sort of orrible tropical bird (poor bird! they could let him survive, because the sacrifice was too much in this case!!)\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Anonymous\n            \n        \n        \n            No joke, grandma had one of those in perriwinkle.
