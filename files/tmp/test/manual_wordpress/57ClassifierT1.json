{"title":"bottega veneta milk papier lam","text":" Bottega Veneta Milk Papier Lambskin Bag By Kelly Cook on  May 2, 2011 6:00 am  Kelly CookDon\u2019t be fooled by this photo, this bag is a slouchy hobo that drapes in perfection.  The leather is paper thin with a slight laminate that gives it an actual paper texture.  When you have it on your shoulder the texture of the leather allows for incredible draping that isn\u2019t too scrunched, you get that perfect sculptural scallop.  There is a hidden magnetic closure so when the two sides are closed, the draping is more of a fold.  You get subtle changes in the look depending on how it slouches.  The strap is long enough to hang comfortably at your side and it stays on!  It is also super lightweight.  I can\u2019t decide what I love most \u2013 the shape, function or beauty!  It is stark white, gorgeous for summer, but do not fear, the paper laminate allows for easy spot cleaning.
