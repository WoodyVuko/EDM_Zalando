{"title":"a note on the note","text":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2012-02-10\n\t\t\tA Note on the Note\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>> I know chronology, location and basically all sense of time and place is a little messed up here on the blog.  I blogged about Paris whilst I was in New York and now I'm about to blog about London whilst I'm still in New York.  So just to re-iterate, I am in fact in New York for fashion week.  It hasn't properly kicked off and some of the gems I saw yesterday (GOOOOOO\u2026. Creatures of the Wind\u2026. a little like supporting Colours of the Wind, but with CLOTHES!) I'm saving up for when I see their showroom.  Just to say that I'll be doing more blogging on the go on shows via Twitter, Facebook and possibly Tumblr with a handy help from Samsung's Galaxy Note.  It's got a pen.  It's a got a highlighter effect.  I might be inflicting my poor sketching skills on the world but I'm actually finding the experience a whole lot more fun than merely putting up a TwitPic or a 140 character flimsy opinion.  Beware though of overusage of the exclamation mark.  It's what happens when I weld a S-pen. \n Disclosure: I really do love this new fandangled bit of gadgetry.  So harp all you want about \"Selling Out\".  Please, by all means.  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t7 Comments »\n\t\t\t\tPosted by susie on 12\/02\/10 | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=\/^http:\/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+':\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","title_lev":0.21428571428571427,"text_jar":0.85,"text_cosine":0.9606671410703104,"url":"http:\/\/stylebubble.co.uk\/style_bubble\/2012\/02\/a-note-on-the-note.html"}
