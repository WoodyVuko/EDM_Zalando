It takes a lot of restraint, trust me. It also requires planning. After weeks of debate and counsel with our in-house shoe snob counsel, Sasha Charnin Morrison, I narrowed my choices down to Valentino\u2019s eclectic studded wedges in brown and Prada\u2019s sickeningly amazing gold-braided platforms. One casual, with mixed materials to keep things interesting, and one fancy, since I realized it was time to give my feet the Midas touch. What else does a girl need for a summer in Europe and Asia?!I\u2019m on the plane right now (love blogging from 30,000 feet up in the air!) and the minute I land I will head to Bergdorf Goodman to pick up my shoes from Eddie, my trusted SA in Bergdorf\u2019s fabulous shoe department.Prada Metallic Braided Strappy Sandal At Bergdorf Goodman for $990.Valentino Studded T-Strap Espadrille At Bergdorf Goodman for $695.
