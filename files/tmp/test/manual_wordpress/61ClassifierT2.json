Then on to Sister by Sibling's first proper presentation in the Portico Rooms.  Sister by Sibling is into its second season and the autumn winter season definitely gave the knitwear label a far more surer footing.  This trio of Joe Bates, Sid Bryan and Cozette McCreery weren't afraid to remix previous motifs from their menswear offering and kapowow us with loud-as-you-can-shout colour combinations.  \nKatie Grand's more-is-more styling helped to amplify what Sibling is all about which is the idea of maintaining classic knitwear shapes but applying the most unlikely patterns to them.  A twin set, nay a tri-set of cardigan, crewneck and vest in highlighter orange leopard print and electric pink and blue Fair Isle would please both the zany granny and the out there club kid as well as a lot of people in between who might take one piece or two.  A knitted faux fur fox stole is another witty knit touch that makes Sibling all the more lovable.  What really hit the spot for me were the sequinned knit jumper and skirts as well as the pom pom adorned skull face, another way of subverting this oft-used badge of rebellion.  Lurex, angora and mohair knits in a similar palette are the more simple foundations of this collection but I think they really need to have the leopard jostling alongside them in order to be a true Sister by Sibling soldier, which is exactly who I wanted to be after seeing the presentation.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA collaboration with Underground, who have done a few shoe collabs this season, means that we get to wear Sibling's Fair Isle knit on pointy creepers as well as an orange leopard print chelsea boots, both likely to go into production.  \n\n\n\nA less likely collaboration sees Sibling giving Barbie six of their key looks from the collection and frankly, she's never looked cooler.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t21 Comments »\n\t\t\t\tPosted by susie on 12\/02\/22 | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=\/^http:\/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+':\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","title_lev":0.18181818181818182,"text_jar":0.87,"text_cosine":0.976519544611612,"url":"http:\/\/stylebubble.co.uk\/style_bubble\/2012\/02\/knit-witting.html"}
