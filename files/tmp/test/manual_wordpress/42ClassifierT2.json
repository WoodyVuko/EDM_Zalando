What happens if like me, you have a belt that matches neither? I simply went for a black belt and let the blazer match the shoes, it still helps getting items in your outfit talking to one another.\nLets look at the details though.\n\nThe camo bow tie was to pick up on the contrast collar of the blazer, it\u2019s also got some black in it so helps blend in with the outfit overall I think.\nTo be able to make this all work, together, I thought a simple white shirt with the slightest texture was best, it has a nice french cuff, so the silver on the watch and cufflink could allÂ work together \u2013 matching metal with metal is key, and perhaps a dressiquette post I need to wright up one day\n\n\nSo If you like this look, below are some online choices to help get you started, the exact blazer and shoes were impossible to find.\n                                                               \nBlazer from Topman \u2013 Get similar here\nShirt from TM Lewin\nBow tie by Heywood1922\nPocket square from H&M \u2013 Get similar here\nLapel flower by Chanman\nPants from Topman\nShoes from Zara \u2013 get \u201Ckinda\u201D similar here\nOkay.
