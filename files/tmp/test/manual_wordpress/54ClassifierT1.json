{"title":"burberry   medium leather chai","text":" Burberry Medium Leather Chain Tote By Kelly Cook on  October 27, 2010 12:00 pm  Kelly CookBurberry has come a long way with making their bags more desirable for the non tartan obsessed.  This belted tote with chain detail is super cool!  I would totally use this and that is not something I can easily say about most Burberry bags.  This is an easy bag to use on a daily basis and it has all the trappings of current looks.  I\u2019m totally loving the chain that dangles off to one side as an accessory for the accessory.  The belted strap can stay unlocked and actually looks good that way.  At Saks Fifth Avenue for $1195.You Will Also Like10 Tips to Get Your Best Skin Ever in 2015Drunk Elephant Founder Breaks Down The Difference Between\u2026How to Keep Long Hair HealthySummer Beauty Tips for Asian Hair and Skin Share This Story    Read more articles about: Tote 7 thoughts on \u201CBurberry Medium Leather Chain Tote\u201D    shoppingqueen4755 says:   October 27, 2010 at 2:16 pm  very rocker chic, LOVE IT!http:\/\/www.shop.com\/trends\/rocker+chicReply     Eva says:   October 27, 2010 at 3:25 pm  Is it just me or has Burberry been pretty fabulous lately, in handbags terms?Reply     Stacy says:   October 27, 2010 at 10:07 pm  This really is a fab bag.

But how many of us can actually afford the real thing? We`ve all thought about replica, and most of us probably owned one, but few admit. I`m not ashamed to share my video with you, sharing is caring, and whoever wants to try these guys out then be it, who doesn`t..makes no difference to meThe first step to happiness is always the hardest, why can`t we all be fabulous for less, way less than thousand dollars ?http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RWLZtvK9828Reply Do you love it or hate it?
