Imagine a real real American dive bar with bartenders with real guys with moustaches and beards etc in the movies where you sit on a stool etc\u2026 that\u2019s what it\u2019s like. Amazing!\nseems that you are having a great time in austin :D\nxo\nFebruary 6, 2012\n@BryanBoy\u2026 I wish I would have known you were coming to town.  I would have found you and bought you and Rumi cocktails.  The Mean Eyed Cat is actually a pretty interesting place.  Drew Barrymore and ScarJo have been spotted there a bunch.  I would have loved to show you around.  Hope you had fun in my town!\nTexas seem harsh, but if you\u2019re having a blast even in there, it just means that your sense of tolerance is more than admirable.\nGreetings from Santiago, Chile.\nYour email address will not be published.
