By Sharon Feiereisen on  March 8, 2011 6:00 am  Sharon Feiereisen The other week I went to a Sephora event to check-out their March\/April Hot Now products and was immediately blown away by Josie Maran\u2019s Argan Matchmaker Serum Foundation ($42). It\u2019s a sci-fi-like foundation that looks white when you apply it on your skin and then a second later it adapts to your color to blend in seamlessly. It comes in a light and dark shade and I was standing next to a woman of color who took the dark shade, while I tried the light one and it actually worked for both of us! Seriously very cool to play with. Its got a light consistency, which I\u2019m guessing is because of the Argan oil in its formulation, so the plus is that aside from not needing to sort through a bunch of shades to find the right one for you, the Matchmaker works double duty to moisturize skin. I personally prefer a thicker formulation however, so while I don\u2019t think I will be giving up my Sensai Liquid Finish Foundation anytime soon (their Natural Beige saved me from years of less than perfect foundation for my skin tone!), there are a bunch of celebrities that could seriously use some help when it comes to matching makeup to their skin.
