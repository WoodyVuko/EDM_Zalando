Every print is available for EUR150 and the full exhibition is at the colette store until 31st March.  I plan on getting ones of myself, Phil and Tommy Ton and hang them up as a trio in my living room, just so I can make future Lau-babies giggle.  \"Look, that's your grandmother as a black one-eyed blob!  How funny \u2013 har-e-har-e-har!\"\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t21 Comments »\n\t\t\t\tPosted by susie on 12\/02\/29 | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=\/^http:\/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+':\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","title_lev":0.15384615384615385,"text_jar":0.84,"text_cosine":0.9574324984774422,"url":"http:\/\/stylebubble.co.uk\/style_bubble\/2012\/02\/darcel-forever.html"}
