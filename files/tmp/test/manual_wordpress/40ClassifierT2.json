What you get is a lot of bold patterns, a lot of \u2018european socks\u2019Â and bad rendition of Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201CMy Way\u201D.\nNo advice or tips to give on this one, I think its something we can just enjoy together.\n                                 \n\nOkay. Stay Fancy.\n \nShare this:TwitterFacebookPinterestTumblrLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\tRelated\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n","title_lev":0.15789473684210525,"text_jar":0.86,"text_cosine":0.936262410645275,"url":"http:\/\/whatmyboyfriendwore.com\/2013\/04\/15\/sartorial-sundays-10\/"}
