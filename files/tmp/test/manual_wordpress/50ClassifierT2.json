{"title":"bolting","text":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2012-02-22\n\t\t\tBolting\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>> As each season progresses, the \"What I wore today at fashion week\" posts here seem to be dwindling.  The rush of getting from show to show, getting to the nearest toilet\/wifi spot\/Topshop food spread (this season, we were treated to haggis on toast, radishes and anchovy dip and ham hock pie \u2013 LUSH!) and getting everything seen and done is increasingly challenging.  I don't look the happiest here in this photo by Ryan Cardiff, but I am wearing the expression of a fashion month-ravaged face (yes, we are in fact only half way through).  Still a piccy post is a piccy post nonetheless and I can still proceed to coo over a fluffy sleeved Simone Rocha A\/W 11-12 jacket which is keeping my arms warm, these Derek Lam 10 Crosby trousers which people keep mistaking for Celine or Tommy Hilfiger and another pair of Underground creepers that ensure the trouser hems don't get wet.  More on actual fashion week when I've answered all of nature's callings \u2013 i.e. pee, food and reading up on The Guardian to see what's going on in the real world.   \n(Simone Rocha jacket, Rag & Bone tartan dress, Derek Lam 10 Crosby trousers, Underground creepers, Phillip Lim Pashli bag)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t26 Comments »\n\t\t\t\tPosted by susie on 12\/02\/22 | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=\/^http:\/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+':\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","title_lev":0.14285714285714285,"text_jar":0.85,"text_cosine":0.9663351988873192,"url":"http:\/\/stylebubble.co.uk\/style_bubble\/2012\/02\/bolting.html"}
