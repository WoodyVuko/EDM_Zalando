I\u2019m a riding boots type of girl, so you will always find me a good pair of broken-in suede motoboots, for the streets of NYC, or the gigs in Austin, Texas this festival season. OR, I go completely opposite\u2026slipping into a colourful loafer, complete with tassel and all! The city in the spring is made for flats to take out with either a lightweight pant or flowing dress. Here, I\u2019m styled in some of my other summer essentials: the turban headband to beat the heat, a silk blouse and pant, and great chunky jewelry (i\u2019m already looking into the perfect arm bands at the moment!) The bohemain vibes of me always come out in the spring. (Bring on the kimonos and buckled boots!) Or, I\u2019m tailored and extra simple. Button-down blouses, and a good summer trouser. Either mood leaves me with a good swipe of black eyeliner, and some silky waves in my hair complete with just a little shake !\n\nInstagram (natalieoffduty)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;\/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n    \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        TAGS: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t38 Replies\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t","title_lev":0.95,"text_jar":0.79,"text_cosine":0.9843198880305329,"url":"http:\/\/natalieoffduty.com\/2014\/02\/shoeline-com-ss-14-campaign-city-troopers\/"}
