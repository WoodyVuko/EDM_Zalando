At left, Miu Miu pays an exhausting homage to the 70s in the same capacity Balenciaga\u2019s Pre Fall relives 1982. The shoes are, how you say, icing on that cake. The groovy heel is reminiscent of something Yves Saint Laurent tried to do a few seasons ago\u2013it\u2019s back and chunkier though\u2013and the satin bow ties the color-blocked shoe together in a package that only reads, For The Miu Miu Girl. At right, Louis Vuitton does something fairly similar with a\u2013note this on both sides\u2013square toe platform to compliment a fancy pants military inspired collection where it sounds like the buzzword is Train. This should yield a general call to put the credit card down and look back to your current belongings. The shoes you\u2019ve got still have a decent couple seasons under their cinderblocks.\n\nAnd in other shews (shoes x news = shews): I am not, however, above the continuing manifestation of senior citizen approved heels on a young, sleek, albeit long leg. Beyond the rising fame of Valentino\u2019s kitten heel, a general interest in the resurgence of the chunkier mini heel started last summer when I found myself gravitating toward a pair of Ferragamo shoes fit for not my grandmother, but her mother. It was only a matter of months before Chanel\u2019s version fell onto my lap and subsequently foot. This was followed by Stella McCartney\u2019s resort push. And that\u2019s just a little biography outlining the happenings of my foot. At left here, Chloe, right Valentino. Ultimately, the moral of this story is to have comfort seekers rejoice in the notion that you don\u2019t have to give up your natural inclinations, that is, avoiding death by shoe, for the sake of your foots well being. And that deserves a hooray.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t                .nrelate_related .nr_sponsored{ left:0px !important; }\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Office Apropos: Spring 2015\n                    \n                    \n                                            by The Writers Â· Fashion\n                                        \n\n                \n             \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        How Avocados Became the Oprah of Instagram\n                    \n                    \n                                            by Amelia Diamond Â· Humor\n                                        \n\n                \n             \n                        \n            \n        \n    \t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \t#pubexchange_below_content .pe-wrapper ul.pe-module li.pe-article {margin: 0px !important; width:100% !important; display:block; min-height:104px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \t.pe-editorial {text-align:left; display:block !important; }\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-headline {line-height:100% !important; padding-top:6px !important; display:block !important;font-style:normal !important; font-size:24px !important; letter-spacing:-1px;}\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-partner-name {font-size:16px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-thumb img {margin-top:0px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-thumb {margin-right:10px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \t.pe-thumb-wrapper {}\n\t\t\t\t \t.pe-partner-name {clear:both; font-style:italic !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                    \n        \n            \nhttp:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/12463023121697072678                TINACIOUS ME\n            \n        \n        \n            \"senior citizen approved heels\" \u2013 you are so hilarious!\nxo, Tinahttp:\/\/WWW.TINACIOUS.MEhttp:\/\/WWW.TINACIOUS.ME\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \nhttp:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/05882333911932324281                blue roses\n            \n        \n        \n            when will someone design a disco stu inspired shoe complete with live goldfish????

Fab post as always~ Long live the platform! A little conundrum for ya: I've been struggling for years in terms of \"proper\" footwear for traveling, i.e. a flat or wedge that won't kill my feet. Last time I traveled to France my feet hated me for insisting on fashionable footwear. Yes, there is always the ballet flat but sometimes they're just so mehhhh. To celebrate my 'dirty 30' I'll be going to San Francisco. My question to you is: Does a comfortable\/fashionable walking shoe exist?!?!\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \nhttp:\/\/styleseer.blogspot.com                Lauren@Styleseer\n            \n        \n        \n            I applaud the resurgence of senior citizen approved heels (just bought a pair of Vara pumps) especially since I am rapidly approaching senior citizenship myself.\nhttp:\/\/styleseer.blogspot.com\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \nhttp:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/07754771070155843910                WearAbouts\n            \n        \n        \n            HOORAY! love it, Leandra! you're always so fun to read <3Roryhttp:\/\/www.WearAboutsBlog.comFollow me on CHICTOPIA\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \nhttp:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/07013236322969861558                Nicole @ Giraffelegs\n            \n        \n        \n            Long live the platforms.
