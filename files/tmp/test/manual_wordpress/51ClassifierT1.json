{"title":"jamie o at home microdermabras","text":" Jamie O \u2013 At home Microdermabrasion By Tina Craig on  April 2, 2007 12:00 pm  Tina CraigI received a sample of the Jamie O at home microdermabrasion kit from Jamie O herself last month.  We have a mutual friend who loves the product and wanted me to try it.  I was hesitant at first because I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d like it and well, you all know how brutal I am when I don\u2019t like something but my friend was so certain I\u2019d love it that she told me to be honest and review it as I would any other product.  She put me in touch with Jamie and within 48 hours a package arrived at my door, the box was the prettiest skincare package I\u2019d ever seen!  Pink with grey trim wrapped in a gorgeous grey ribbon, it was so pretty I didn\u2019t want to open it or mess it up.  I finally opened it tonight and tried the microdermabrasion scrub and let me just say, \u201CWOW\u201D.Every winter I get regular microdermabrasion facials (from Katrina at Cooper Spa!) but it leaves my skin too vulnerable in the summer so I depend on over the counter scrubs to exfoliate during the hot months.  I usually use the Fresh Sugar face polish and La Prairie essential exfoliator but will be adding this to my repertoire.  How is Jamie O different from my other scrubs you ask?  First of all, the crystals are so fine it felt like the soft sands of the Maldives.  And it smelled like a dreamcicle (from the vitamin C).  The best part is the lactic acid to put on top of the scrub called the \u201Cactivator\u201D, my face got really hot for about 5 seconds, very science project-ish and kinda scary at first but it went away very quickly.  After rinsing it off, my skin was smooth like porcelain.  It\u2019s very close to the same smoothness achieved with a professional microdermabrasion machine but at a fraction of the cost.  At $69, it is less than half the price of a one time microdermabrasion session and will last you all summer.

I just don\u2019t have time to go for office visits but can always work it in around the house.  I will have to try all three of these products \u2013 JamieO, Fresh and Laura Mercier.  I have been using one from Origins that I got as a gift and I like it \u2013 but I like to rotate my products.Reply     sara says:   April 4, 2007 at 8:29 pm  I will have to try this.
