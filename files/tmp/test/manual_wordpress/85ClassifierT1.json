 You didn't want to do my hair on that Gap Christmas ad campaign because you said it looked fine as it was and I had sad panda face all day because of that.\"  That would be incredibly sad and dorky though so I resisted the temptation.  \n \n\n\n\nThe boots were also an arduous process.  Thigh high with dozens of eyelets, the lacing up took about three people per model to complete.  They are incidentally the first pair of thigh highs that I've wanted in a long time, which I think has something to do with the shine of the leather and the brogue-like punched detailing.   \n\n\n\nWhen they practised the finale, which hopefully you'll get to see in its mighty glory once McQ put up the full video, I was pretty hysterical.  That's when I started manically tweeting \"Please, guys.  Just watch this.\"  \n\nIt was really hard not to overdose on shots of McMenamy and her closing look.  \n\n\nAs for the rest of the collection, it ran the gamut from the pragmatic and slick military moss green coats and jackets to the fantasy of a tutu dress embroidered with flowers.  Everything was waisted and tightened to the proportions that one expects from McQueen.  The Black Watch tartan was more than a nod to the notorious Highland Rape collection and has actually featured in previous McQ collections but looks more polished here as a bustier dress over a lace top or as a dramatic flared out frock coat. The menswear was perhaps slightly erring on the more casual side when compared with the womenswear but that didn't lessen the direction of the show which was WWII military in spirit to begin with and then darkened into a tangible woodland fantasy where burgandy velvet devorâˆšÂ© with leaf motifs, a rainbow cornucopia of fabric flowers and cut silk and knots of silk made to look like moss growing on a rock all take over.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe finale, as some of you will have seen, featured McMenamy emerging on to the dried leaf covered catwalk and standing there, illuminated like a Titania-esque statue with leaves falling from above.  She then looks up bewildered and lost and finds nestled under the leaves, a rope that guides her to a dramatic reveal of a woodland scene and into a curious looking hut.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there's an unexpected blaring of techno from this hidden club, to which we were all invited in to (provided you can elbow your way in through the throng of guests) afterwards for a drink or two with McMenamy revelling in all the photo snapping and looking like she owned this joint called the Core Club.  According to the receipts plastered all over the walls, there are a ton of lifetime members, perhaps an allusion to the lifelong dedicated fans of Alexander McQueen, both brand and person.  That's a Core Club that you can happily sign me up to.       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t29 Comments »\n\t\t\t\tPosted by susie on 12\/02\/21 | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=\/^http:\/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+':\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","title_lev":0.16666666666666666,"text_jar":0.89,"text_cosine":0.9919104158963741,"url":"http:\/\/stylebubble.co.uk\/style_bubble\/2012\/02\/into-the-woods.html"}
