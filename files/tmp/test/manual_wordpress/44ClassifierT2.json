Sometimes throwing in some black for a darker colour.\nNow, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, in fact blue and grey are a fine combination and personally I could (and pretty much do) have my wardrobe consisting of only those colours. Yes! Grey is a colour.\nToday however, I decided I would shift it all up a little, so much so that I did a Fancy Friday on a Monday morning which I usually reserve for being \u2018casual\u2019. I wanted it to be colourful and just a little loud, so of course I started with purple pants. You kinda have to really. Once you go bold though, you cant turn back, and the trick becomes adding piece after piece of pattern, texture and brightness to make sure that it all works together despite the fact that it shouldn\u2019t.\nIn this case, I kinda decided that I was going to build the outfit around my shoes, rather than the pants. I cant seem to stop wearing these double monks \u2013 they go with everything \u2013 despite being a reddish oxblood colour. So in this case, the red \/ brown detailing in the tie, picked up on the shoes, and the red lapel flower, brought out the red in the tie more, which made it work better with the shoes. I also wanted to funk up my accessories a bit, while remaining in the same colour palette.\nEnter wood! Yep! Wood! Been meaning to bust out this Original Grain watch for some time now especially because it paired so perfectly with my wooden tie clip! Wood and steel for the win.\nHere are the details below, hopefully it helps the above make sense.\nSunglasses by RayBan (these guys are vintage though)\nBlazer from Gap (available locally at Stuttafords)\nShirt from GapÂ (available locally atÂ Stuttafords)\nTie by LVJ Haberdasher\nTie clip by Nic Harry Style\nLapel Flower by Nic Harry Style\nPocket Square by Heywood1922\nWatch by Original Grain\nPants by Topman\nShoes from Paul Evans NY\nOkay.
