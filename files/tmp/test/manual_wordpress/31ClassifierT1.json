Yes, it\u2019s winter and almost so unbearably cold that all I feel like doing is bumming it. Everything is suddenly oversize and it\u2019s completely acceptable to swim in your jeans (well, when they\u2019re Current Elliot). Every single day I have to throw that one extra piece over me just to get to the subway. And with fashion week, all I really want to be do is run from show to show in little frocks and cute leather jackets! Believe me, I\u2019ve already stepped out in little things that are so NOT winter appropriate. It\u2019s nearly been day 1 to fashion week and already there\u2019s event after event, drink after drink, and all I want to do is curl up in a ball and take a cat nap. For now, I\u2019ll be around Lincoln Center. First stop? BCBG, and ending tonight at Kenneth Cole. See you there!\nFollow all of my NYFW adventures on Instagram!
