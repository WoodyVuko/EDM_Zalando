I promptly flooded his inbox with infographics on the effect of girls\u2019 education, which is largely accepted as the most efficient means to fighting poverty globally. Literally. Check out the infographic.\nWhat\u2019s even more surprising is that a major obstacle to girls\u2019 education in the developing worldÂ is menstruation, which causes many girls to miss a quarter of their schooling.Â It never occurred to me that a woman\u2019s period would prevent her from doing\u2026 anything. Except maybe wearing white, or swimming in shark-infested waters. I assumed everyone had some means of handling their flow and going on with their day-to-day lives. Not the case.\nWhich is why I fell in love with programs likeÂ Pads for PeaceÂ and Pads4Girls. In the case of Pads for Peace, anÂ Eliminate Poverty NowÂ project, not only are girls receiving washable menstrual pads â\u20AC\u201C enabling them to stay on top of their school work and continue their education â\u20AC\u201C the â\u20AC˜RockPadsâ\u20AC™ are manufactured at a local sewing center at Little Rock ECD Centre in Nairobi, Kenya, creating jobs for women in the community.\nIssues like global poverty are so mammoth it\u2019s sometimes overwhelming for a single person wanting to help. The fact that these programs isolate an obstacle and offer an uncomplicated, effective solution is wonderfully refreshing. And the end result \u2013 girls receiving an education \u2013 is the best part.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t                .nrelate_related .nr_sponsored{ left:0px !important; }\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Three Ways to Look Cool at a Summer Wedding\n                    \n                    \n                                            by Leandra Medine Â· Style\n                                        \n\n                \n             \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Styling a Real Woman\n                    \n                    \n                                            by Amelia Diamond Â· Shopping\n                                        \n\n                \n             \n                        \n            \n        \n    \t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \t#pubexchange_below_content .pe-wrapper ul.pe-module li.pe-article {margin: 0px !important; width:100% !important; display:block; min-height:104px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \t.pe-editorial {text-align:left; display:block !important; }\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-headline {line-height:100% !important; padding-top:6px !important; display:block !important;font-style:normal !important; font-size:24px !important; letter-spacing:-1px;}\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-partner-name {font-size:16px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-thumb img {margin-top:0px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \ta.pe-thumb {margin-right:10px !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \t.pe-thumb-wrapper {}\n\t\t\t\t \t.pe-partner-name {clear:both; font-style:italic !important;}\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                    \n        \n            \n                Amelia Diamond\n            \n        \n        \n            Kate this is so important and I love this post.\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Emily Pinto\n            \n        \n        \n            I\u2019m so happy to see this issue brought up on a platform like this.

I was teary-eyed the whole time. Big takeaway\u2013 all over the world (including the US), when a girl is educated, she contributes her skills to the entire community. When a boy is educated, he is much less likely to do this.\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Selena Aponte\n            \n        \n        \n            Although I had no idea these programs even existed for females, the practice of altruism is a key factor in boosting self-esteem.
