American designers Richard Lambertson and John Truex founded the company seven years ago and have established themselves as one of the most original and innovative design houses in the fashion industry.  Lambertson Truex bags are known for their modern interpretation of classic luxury as well as commitment to fine craftmanship and they have developed a loyal following around the world.
