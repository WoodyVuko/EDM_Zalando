Anderson. Â They are all brands with sure fire longevity in the making (or in Kaneâ\u20AC™s case, this already exists). Â There were also some curveball answers like Jeremy Scott or Alexander Wang, who are perhaps diametricallyÂ oppositeÂ toÂ McQueen. Â Perhaps people got stuck on the word legacy and thought of the brands that would go the distance.\nTo conclude my collaboration with American Express, which first began with a visit to the McQueen: Savage Beauty exhibition at the V&A, I wanted to put togetherÂ a list ofÂ trailblazingÂ designersÂ that I think draw comparison with McQueenÂ on an aesthetic level, but that also place innovation and experimentation at the heart of what they do,Â and who might also merit having theirÂ workÂ scrutinised byÂ a museum curator twenty years from now, just as McQueen has. Â Nowadays, the word â\u20AC˜groundbreakingâ\u20AC™ isnâ\u20AC™t often seen in fashion showÂ reviews, unless used as hyperbole. Â And yet I believe that McQueen, for all his love of the historical and the traditional, did break new ground, whether it was in the cut of a silhouette or in his mode of showmanship. Â Therefore perhaps the question should be different:Â Â Who is currently innovating fashion and pushing it to somewhere that can be called â\u20AC˜newâ\u20AC™?\nThe one name that did get crop upÂ on Instagram unsurprisingly, was Dutch designerÂ Iris van Herpen.If not for the stylistic and thematic similarities, then for her demi-couture approach that only recently saw her branch off from haute couture to ready to wear. Â In my opinion, you can see her work is no less considered, as incredible close-up shots of the fabrics from her latest â\u20ACœHacking Infinityâ\u20AC? A\/W 15-6 collection reveal. Â Her work simply does not come from the realm of convention,Â nor is it bound by a sense of reality.Â Â \nFor her latest collection, van Herpen imagined the biosphere of another planet and the textures that might inhabit its terrain. Â A stainless steel weave is burnt so that it glimmers with hues of an oil-slick and then pleated and shaped into circular formations.Â Â A 3D hand woven grid-like textile is created in collaboration with Aleksandra Gaca,Â creatingÂ an optical illusion. Â In an ongoing bid to constantly look beyond fashion, van Herpen also works with professor ofÂ architectureÂ Philip Beesley, to design sculptural dresses made out of fractal-like geometries. Â Crystals crafted from 3D printing grow from beneath the vertiginous heels of Noritaka Tatehana. Â McQueen had already begun to probe the dystopian questions ofÂ how the world might look in the future.Â Â Van Herpen has set herself the path to take that probing further, aided by technologies in fabricationsÂ that McQueen mayÂ have delved into himself.Â \n               \nIt might be fair to say Kunihiko Morinaga of AnrealageÂ has drawnÂ more comparisons with Hussein Chalayan than Alexander McQueen. His shows,Â which have decamped from Tokyo Fashion Week to Paris for the last two seasons,Â deserve praise for their willingness to open our jaded eyes to something really new.Â Â Last season for Morinagaâ\u20AC™s Paris debut, he played with photo and heat sensitive inks on white garments so that faint patterns would be revealed when shone with laser-like beams of light.Â Â Â \nThis season, the effect was more dramatic as it was inverted with seemingly black fabrics made to reveal hidden patterns under ultraviolet light.Â Â That effect was pre-empted with blacked-out garments printed with fade-in\/fade-out patterns. In the final portion of the show, outÂ trooped models in black ensemblesÂ which were embedded with photochromic patterns, that could only be seen when under UV light.Â Â The UV spotlights moving around revealed distinct patterns of polka dots, floral prints and checks that would then disappear into darkness as soon as the UV was switched off.Â Â Itâ\u20AC™s difficult to assess where all this supreme fabric research and innovation can go in the practical world,Â but I believe Morinaga is shining a spotlight (literally) on what may be possibleÂ in the world of textiles and thereâ\u20AC™s still so much potential. Â Anrealageâ\u20AC™sÂ shows are a feast for the brain.Â Â You leave excited about what is next.\n          \n\n\n\nA video posted by @susiebubblevid on May 21, 2015 at 6:08am PDT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA video posted by Susie Lau (@susiebubble) on Mar 3, 2015 at 8:55am PST\n\n\n\nFinally,Â The UnseenÂ isnâ\u20AC™t a fashion label per se,Â but to me, it embodies the trailblazing spirit of McQueen in what it does.Â Â Founded by self-proclaimed alchemist Lauren Bowker, who studied printed textiles at the Royal College of Art, The Unseen is more like a house of exploration, focusingÂ onÂ the metamorphosis of materials.Â Â Bowker has been creating chromic, colour-chana inks that can then be applied to various disciplines, with fashion being one of them.Â Â Alongside Bowker, The Unseen, now based in the Vaults in Somerset House, consists of anatomists, engineers, chemists and pattern cutters, who collectively aim to put their â\u20ACœmagickâ\u20AC? into bespoke projects.Â Â \n\n\nTheir work is primarily based around inks that are sensitive to wind, heat, moisture and light and they, in turn, have been applied toÂ couture piecesÂ that act as a spectacular showcaseÂ in terms of what The Unseen can do. Â For example,Â a winged cape that changes colour upon contact with the air around it, or a skull cap glowing with Swarovski spinel stones that visualise the heat loss from the head,Â graduating in colour from orange to red to green, to blue to purple.Â  Its latest piece entitled, â\u20ACœEight Senseâ\u20AC? is a coded couture piece, which changes in response to real-time digital media as it aims to discover and investigate the human state of being, by using a physical garment linked with human magnetism. Â \n\n\n\nSo, basicallyâ\u20AC¦ a wearable mood ring?Â  You might ask, who really needs that?Â  But when the effects are so beautiful, it makes you wonder how much more we can explore by bringing chemistry and fashion together. Â Youâ\u20AC™re more than welcome to find out more by visitingÂ The Unseen as they continue their explorative residency at Somerset House.Â  Iâ\u20AC™ll be delving deeper intoÂ what theirÂ â\u20ACœmagickâ\u20AC? entails soon enoughÂ and keeping an eye on all the aforementioned talent to see how they continue to trail blaze in their work; just as Alexander McQueen did before them.\n\n         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t10 Comments »\n\t\t\t\tPosted by susie on 15\/05\/22 | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=\/^http:\/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+':\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","title_lev":0.19047619047619047,"text_jar":0.88,"text_cosine":0.9773082213821853,"url":"http:\/\/stylebubble.co.uk\/style_bubble\/2015\/05\/the-next-savage-beauties.html"}
