When all else fails, go military.\nWe all know that women love a man in uniform, but this shouldn\u2019t mean having to put your life at risk to attract that perfect mate. Most of mens fashion can be traced back to the military anyway, Khakis, T shirts, Pea Coats, even those aviator sunglasses Mr Wooster has on up there. Fashion designers merely take something that was designed as functional and tip their hats to it.\nSo, when you\u2019re stuck with what to wear, just ask yourself \u201Cwhat would Joe do?\u201D Gi Joe, that is.\nOkay. Stay Fancy.\n \n \nShare this:TwitterFacebookPinterestTumblrLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\tRelated\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n","title_lev":0.15,"text_jar":0.88,"text_cosine":0.9584808133995164,"url":"http:\/\/whatmyboyfriendwore.com\/2012\/12\/12\/wooster-wednesdays-10\/"}
