You see, James Brudnell wore it because he could slip it on and off without disarranging his hair and after that whole disastrous cavalry ride made him the talk of the town, the cardigan was adopted as a fashion craze in high society.\nIt was only after the Second World War that cardigans left the world of formal attire and became symbolic of relaxation. From here on they were adopted by golfers and singers alike, everyone from Arnold Palmer to Bing Crosby and even singers who like to golf like ol\u2019 blue eyes, Mr Frank Sinatra, who was said to have dropped $30 000 a year on knitwear at his local club house.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Kurt Cobain wore his cardigan in the 1990\u2019s as part of his grunge look that the garment lost its grandpa stigma and became a piece of the modern mans wardrobe. For me, the cardigan still carries I like a little bit of both worlds, the \u2018dapper granmps\u2019 and the \u2018urban trendsetter\u2019 which makes it super versatile.\nSo, why do I consider it an essential, well, I just said, it\u2019s super versatile, it works as well casually with some jeans and a t-shirt as it does layered under a sports coat with a tie, or even worn as a jacket on its own.\nI reccomend getting a couple in different textures and weights, each of them will offer a different wardrobe solution.\nThe one above is my current favourite, Its nice and chunky and really nails the grandpa look with that roll (or shawl) collar.
