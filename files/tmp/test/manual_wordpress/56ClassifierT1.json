{"title":"abba pure detox shampoo 845 oz","text":" ABBA Pure Detox Shampoo: Send Your Hair to Rehab By Kelly Cook on  April 28, 2011 12:00 pm  Kelly CookBe prepared: I\u2019m pretty excited about this! I experienced crazy amazing, plentiful results from ABBA\u2018s Pure Detox Shampoo. You know how your body needs a good detoxing sometimes? Well, our hair is the same. The build-up from products, chlorine, pollution, and simple hair grease take their toll \u2013 and every so often our hair needs a chance to get back to its natural state. Well, only a good total cleansing can achieve that. Sure, the delicate shampoos are great to prevent stripping and drying, but once in awhile you need more.So how about a shampoo that is gentle, but cleans your hair so thoroughly that it is actually softer, more manageable, and more voluminous? So much so that you don\u2019t\u2019 even recognize it as your own hair?! I bought this shampoo in preparation for the impending summer of swimming in pools, thinking it would be the perfect product to purify my hair of chlorine.I decided to test it out ahead of time and was blown away. My hair took on a whole new characteristic. I had thought my hair felt heavy because of its thickness \u2013 and that was why it seemed so \u201Cunstylable.\u201D But I was wrong \u2013 it was all because of toxic build-up. After one shampooing my hair was as smooth and shiny as if I\u2019d just gotten a blow-out. It felt completely different \u2013 soft and feathery \u2013 something I never thought my hair could ever be. Made with molasses and baking soda, the consistency and color is just like molasses. It wafts a hint of a Chinese herbal scent, which I personally love, but it might take others some getting used to. I followed up with Pure Basic Trumint Conditioner, which hydrated my hair and scalp. Its scent of rosemary and mint is really nice. I recommend using both \u2013 but if anything, the shampoo is a must try!
