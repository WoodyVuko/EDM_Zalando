{"title":"lanvin silver hero","text":" Lanvin Silver Hero By Tina Craig on  January 17, 2007 12:00 pm  Tina CraigLanvin Silver Hero is impossibly chic and just exudes style and polish.  You all know how I adore Alber Elbaz, he has seriously never disappointed me.  Whether it be dresses (my Lanvin spring dresses are starting to arrive at Barneys! Just picked up the ivory one today), bags, belts, or killer cone heels, Lanvin is the ultimate for me.  What other designer delivers on every aspect of it\u2019s line?  Hermes has it\u2019s iconic birkins but the Gaultier designed clothes are so boring, Chanel bags are the good ol\u2019 classics but the clothing of late lack inspiration (I mean how many little Chanel tweed jackets do I need? They all look alike after a while), Fendi should have stuck with the ever popular baguette instead of a slew of hideous self proclaimed \u201Cit\u201D bags (although I love it\u2019s line of clothes by Karl), everyone agrees that Jimmy Choo shoes are fab but the bags should not be seen in the light of day, and Valentino, well you guys knows how we feel about it\u2019s line of bags.  But Lanvin, Lanvin is magical, and yes, I am biased but don\u2019t tell me this bag doesn\u2019t make you want to whip out your Amex!  We love the chunky chain links, it\u2019s more youthful and fresh than classic chain straps and it modernizes the traditional baguette shape.  We also love the buttery soft metallic silver lambskin, think of silver as the new black in your bag wardrobe and wear it with everything!  $1,200 At Barneys New York Dallas 469-221-4723 (The best staffed and stocked Barneys store, including the very dapper Jackson, Barneys\u2019 Personal Concierge who can get you just about anything your heart desires)You Will Also Like10 Tips to Get Your Best Skin Ever in 2015Top Ivory Additions: Off-Whites So RightThe Bag Snob\u2019s Tina Craig Shares Her Ultimate Insider\u2026Top Ten Trends of Fall 2015 New York Fashion Week Share This Story    Read more articles about: Chanel, Fendi, Hermes, Jimmy Choo, Lanvin, The Latest \"Snob\" Bags 6 thoughts on \u201CLanvin Silver Hero\u201D    Trish says:   January 17, 2007 at 2:59 pm  Love it!
