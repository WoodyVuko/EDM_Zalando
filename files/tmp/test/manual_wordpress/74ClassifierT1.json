See, pink should be every go to guys shirt colour. Why? Well, unlike yellow, grey or any other muted colour, pink gets even the palest of men to take on a healthy glow. It also shows confidence, yep, even though pink has worked it\u2019s way into every menswear department and subsequent boardroom, it still carries the stigma of being a girls colour. Don\u2019t let it!\nLook at Nick! Does he look like a girl to you??\u2026Well, the badd ass tattoo\u2019s certainly help!\nNice ink Mr Wooster, nice ink!\nOkay.Stay fancy.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookPinterestTumblrLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\tRelated\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n","title_lev":0.15,"text_jar":0.87,"text_cosine":0.9637594764182087,"url":"http:\/\/whatmyboyfriendwore.com\/2013\/03\/06\/wooster-wednesdays-20\/"}
