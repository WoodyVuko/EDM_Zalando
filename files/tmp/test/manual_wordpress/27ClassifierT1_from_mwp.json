I wash them in cold and sometime toss them in the dryer or line dry them. I say \u201Cthem\u201D because I\u2019ve done it to 3 now. All with awesome results. I love the way they hang and clearly don\u2019t need them for warmth or to button up but are perfect for work. \u2026 last seen here {I clearly wear this one the most \u2026but here\u2019s the navy one paired with a dress I just saw Eva Longoria wearing recently actually {and from when I used my iMac to shoot my photos & at work, hilarious!}\n* White cutout\/lace trim skirt \u2026from a local Farmer\u2019s Market a couple years ago. Tag says HiBiS Lace Works \u2013 Van Couver | Los Angeles \u2026 last seen here {wow, these old outfit posts are like a time machine. It takes a while to get you\u2019re photos right \u2026and I\u2019m sure in another year, I\u2019ll say the same about these}\n* Vintage belt \u2026I would have actually preferred this rad belt from ASOS {which I just bought} seen on Smile yesterday because I\u2019m not 100% loving the one I\u2019m wearing but it was the closest match\n* L.A.M.B. studded sandals\nfrom GILT I absolutely love these heels but they are a bit high even for me \u2026though if my ankle weren\u2019t in need of a doctor\u2019s visit, I\u2019d be fine but since it\u2019s so swollen, it\u2019s hard for me to arch it right \u2026I know, I know \u2026I\u2019m making doctor rounds\n","title_lev":0.0,"text_jar":0.0,"text_cosine":0.8768574050830434,"url":"http:\/\/www.lovemaegan.com\/2010\/09\/i-am-ready-for-the-road-less-traveled.html"}
