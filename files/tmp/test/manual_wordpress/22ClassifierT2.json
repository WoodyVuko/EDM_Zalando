On Wednesday, both E. Tautz as well as Oliver Spencer showed their collections, which were my favorites in London (recap has yet to come!). Before Oliver Spencer started, we were part of a little catastrophe: a hot water pipe burst open and steaming hot water started raining on dozens of people who had already taken their seats. After a quick break, and luckily no cancellation, everything was restored and we could enjoy the show.\nDuring London Collections I spent a lot of time at \u201CThe Apartment\u201C, which was a rented apartment, as a hangout spot for bloggers and other attendees of LC:M in between shows. It was so nice to meet different people there, and have a little refuge to regain some strength, as running around can be quite exhausting. Also, they are sponsored by awesome brands such as Fossil and Russel & Bromley, which is where I got the bag and shoes from, respectively.\nMy time in London is now almost over, and it has been a fantastic experience, with wonderful people I have met and beautiful places I have seen and been to \u2013 until the next time, London!\nÂ \nShare Your Passion \u2013 Marcel \n                   \n                                \n                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                \n                                \n                \n                                \n\t\t\t\t\n                \t\t\t\t\n                                        \n                    \tPrevious articleLC:M Day II                    \n                                        \n                                        \n                     \n                    \n                                        \n                        Next articleGo Native \u2013 London                    \n                                    \n\t\t\t\t                \n                \n                                \n                \n                \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t5 Comments\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n    \n    \t    \n\n    \n    \tReply        January 12, 2014\n        \n\t\t\tOliver Lips        \t        \n    \n    \n\t\n\t\t\t\tA really nice look, especially the tassel loafers :)\nhttp:\/\/www.lips2lagerfeld.com\nhttp:\/\/www.lips2lagerfeld.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    \n    \t    \n\n    \n    \tReply        January 12, 2014\n        \n\t\t\tIgal Reysher        \t        \n    \n    \n\t\n\t\t\t\tGreat Outfir Marcel.\nLove the watch.\nIgal\nhttp:\/\/www.thecuriousgentleman.blogspot.co.il\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    \n    \t    \n\n    \n    \tReply        January 12, 2014\n        \n\t\t\tStefano Chierici        \t        \n    \n    \n\t\n\t\t\t\tGREAT LOOK MARCEL \nhttp:\/\/theguyinmilano.blogspot.com\/\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    \n    \t    \n\n    \n    \tReply        January 13, 2014\n        \n\t\t\tJUICYGUILE        \t        \n    \n    \n\t\n\t\t\t\tLove the look! \nhttp:\/\/www.juicyguile.com\n:)\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    \n    \t    \n\n    \n    \tReply        January 13, 2014\n        \n\t\t\tLucy ShinyThoughts        \t        \n    \n    \n\t\n\t\t\t\tee!
