{"title":"its up to you","text":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2012-02-14\n\t\t\tIt\u2019s Up to You\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>> You know how I like to mix in a bit of short n' sweet with the long-ass posts.  I've not been all that diligent with snapping my outfits because of all the rushing around and yesterday, the only real quiet moment I had was at the Chris Benz presentation at the Lincoln Center where the lovely Rachel Scroggins very kindly did the photographing honours.  There's nothing here that you've not seen before except that I was trialling the tucking in of the hair inside a white poloneck a Celine A\/W 11-12.  I'm not sure how successful it was as the abundance of hair kept on trying to escape out of its white poloneck trap. \n\n\n\n(Suno jacket, Peter Jensen lurex sweaters, Christopher Kane white shirt, Uniqlo white heat tech poloneck underneath, Miu Miu x Pop shoes, Theyskens Theory bag)\nOn another outfit note, Grazia recently shot me for their bi-annual bumper fashion issue which is about three times bigger than the normal weekly dose.  The issue will be out during London Fashion Week and in addition, they've created lots of little vids in the run-up to the launch of the issue, including a little vid of our shoot.  Phil Taylor was shooting and the lovely Hannah Almassi was doing all the organising.  I salute whoever came up with the idea of getting readers to decide what I wear on the first day of London Fashion Week.  It's not a complete free rein as I picked all the outfits but hey, it is a bit of interactive fun that is mind fluffingly easy.  \n\n\n\nSo we have a J.W. Anderson ensemble, a Leutton Postle jumper and a Miu Miu skirt, a Louise Gray crop top and skirt and a Christopher Kane dress with a vintage kimono.  See?  I'm not exactly laying out a nasty fate for myself so I'm happy to have you guys do the choosing for me.  Vote here on Grazia Daily via their comments or Twitter.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t29 Comments »\n\t\t\t\tPosted by susie on 12\/02\/14 | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=\/^http:\/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+':\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","title_lev":0.36363636363636365,"text_jar":0.87,"text_cosine":0.9829955297965436,"url":"http:\/\/stylebubble.co.uk\/style_bubble\/2012\/02\/its-up-to-you.html"}
