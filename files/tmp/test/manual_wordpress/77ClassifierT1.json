Not very acurate I know, but I\u2019m terrible at math.\nThey\u2019re all in various stages of disrepair (some bought that way) and all in a variety of washes and fits from a plethora of brands.\nRecently though, I received my first pair of \u2018raw\u201D denim \u2013 a pair of G-Star Raw jeans you may have seen me wearing on my Instagram lately \u2013 now, raw denim (or dry denim) is denim that has not been washed after dying and is left in a solid un destressed state (SPOILER ALERT for below video)\nThe only problem for me was\u2026well, how do I keep it like this?\nApparently (according to the salesmen at all high end denim retailers) you should never wash your jeans! Ever! The fabric softener ruins them\u2026blah blah, etc etc.\nFine, but also GROSS!\nSo I turned to the internet and found this:\n\nI mean, who\u2019s going to argue with Mr Porter right?\nOkay. Stay fancy.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookPinterestTumblrLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\tRelated\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n","title_lev":0.2,"text_jar":0.88,"text_cosine":0.9590430196365091,"url":"http:\/\/whatmyboyfriendwore.com\/2015\/04\/14\/jeans-keep-em-clean-people\/"}
