{"title":"catty","text":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2012-02-11\n\t\t\tCatty\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>> Apologies for things looking a little slow on the NYFW blogging front.  You know how I like \u2013 nice and slow, taking my time, chillaxing with showroom visits and then unleashing them slowly with oozy motion.  Hmmm\u2026 am I talking about fashion shows?  Beware.  When one wakes up at 5am every day from relentless jet lag, words like \"ooze\" and \"chillaxing\" leave the keyboard.  I'm going to be knuckling down throughout the day in the spare hours to quickly catch up but for now, here's a little catty something something.  A pair of \"Va Va\" Karen Walker sunglasses together with an Opening Ceremony x Glamour (a weird collaboration that reads like yoghurt and marmite but somehow works\u2026) cat eye sweater that has been doing the street style rounds gave me super charged cat power.  Not the persona or the singer alas, but the type of cat power that gives me the strength to zip around shows, not feel the increasingly abrasive cold and also answer interview questions about Downton Abbey (I LOVE the fact that Downton has gone Stateside and that I'm suddenly the token British spokesperson to talk about it in fashion interviews).\nIn addition to the cat power, I've pulled another Topshop shocker.  Meaning I wore something from Topshop and people go \"No?  Really?  Topshop?!?\"  This Topshop Boutique skirt and matching bomber jacket are poofy in all the right places and features a nubbly graphic weave in the polyester that makes you think polyester is actually incredible as a fabric.  To top it all off, these Simone Rocha wedges got a proper trial.  Walkability?  A half an hour walk and they start hurting a little but err shamfully, I get to zip around in a Range Rover Evoque for the week, so I get to practise the art of swinging your legs elegantly out of a car without looking like a tangle of limbs.      \n\n\n\n(Photograph above by Nam for Grazia.it)\n(Yes, I'm getting incredibly juvenile with my S-pen that comes with the Samsung Galaxy Note that I've been using\u2026)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t47 Comments »\n\t\t\t\tPosted by susie on 12\/02\/11 | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=\/^http:\/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+':\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","title_lev":0.2,"text_jar":0.87,"text_cosine":0.9763263228369746,"url":"http:\/\/stylebubble.co.uk\/style_bubble\/2012\/02\/catty.html"}
