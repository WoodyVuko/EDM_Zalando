{"title":"","text":"Kate Barnett October 11, 2013\nFACEBOOK\nPINTEREST\nEMAIL IT\nWhen I told my boyfriend that today is UN sanctionedÂ  International Day of the GirlÂ Child , he asked if that wasn\u2019t a bit exclusive. I promptly flooded his inbox with infographics on the effect of girls\u2019 education, which is largely accepted as the most efficient means to fighting poverty globally. Literally. Check out the infographic.\nWhat\u2019s even more surprising is that a major obstacle to girls\u2019 education in the developing worldÂ is menstruation, which causes many girls to miss a quarter of their schooling.Â It never occurred to me that a woman\u2019s period would prevent her from doing\u2026 anything. Except maybe wearing white , or swimming in shark-infested waters. I assumed everyone had some means of handling their flow and going on with their day-to-day lives. Not the case.\nWhich is why I fell in love with programs likeÂ  Pads for Peace Â and Pads4Girls . In the case of Pads for Peace , anÂ  Eliminate Poverty Now Â project, not only are girls receiving washable menstrual pads â\u20AC\u201C enabling them to stay on top of their school work and continue their education â\u20AC\u201C the â\u20AC˜RockPadsâ\u20AC™ are manufactured at a local sewing center at Little Rock ECD Centre in Nairobi, Kenya , creating jobs for women in the community.\nIssues like global poverty are so mammoth it\u2019s sometimes overwhelming for a single person wanting to help. The fact that these programs isolate an obstacle and offer an uncomplicated, effective solution is wonderfully refreshing. And the end result \u2013 girls receiving an education \u2013 is the best part.\n","title_lev":0.0,"text_jar":0.83,"text_cosine":0.9530696868889488,"url":"http:\/\/www.manrepeller.com\/best_of_internet\/international-day-of-the-girl.html"}
