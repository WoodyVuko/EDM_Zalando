{"title":"sensai eye wrinkle cream","text":" Review: Sensai Eye Wrinkle Cream By Tina Craig on  October 9, 2009 12:00 pm  Tina CraigIf you are under the age of 35, skip to the next blog article.  Now, if you\u2019re about to enter the new age bracket (the 35-45 box at the doctor\u2019s office) or above, you need to know about this!  I was sent a sample of Sensai\u2019s Eye Wrinkle cream a month ago and despite the PR person warning me it was very rich and probably best for a more mature skin, I generously applied it twice a day.  The consistency is really thick but goes on fairly smoothly and I liked how it nourishing it felt around the eyes (and diminished the lines!).  However, I noticed a tiny white bump under my right eye recently which my facialist tells me is probably from over use of the very rich eye cream!  So I\u2019m back to using my iS clinical eye cream (heard they have a new version coming, out can\u2019t wait!) and saving this for days I feel really old and tired.  If you are very dry or have very mature skin\u2013 definitely try this.  Go ask for a sample at the counter at Neiman\/Bergdorf and see if it\u2019s too rich for you.  I\u2019m an eye cream addict and slather on eye cream like there\u2019s no tomorrow but now I will use the tiny bit that they always recommend because I don\u2019t want those little white bumps to appear again! Sensai Eye Wrinkle Cream $170 at Bergdorfgoodman.com  You Will Also Like10 Tips to Get Your Best Skin Ever in 2015The Bag Snob\u2019s Tina Craig Shares Her Ultimate Insider\u2026Should You Get Botox to Prevent Wrinkles?Summer Beauty Tips for Asian Hair and Skin Share This Story    Read more articles about: Eye Cream, Eyes 5 thoughts on \u201CReview: Sensai Eye Wrinkle Cream\u201D    Lori says:   October 9, 2009 at 1:18 pm  Hi Tina-are you still happy with the results of the IS clinical products?Reply     Beauty Snob Tina says:   October 10, 2009 at 9:51 am  Hi LoriYes, I am.

I just hope it will make it so my lines aren\u2019t magnified by my eyeglasses. YIKES! $170 is a lot to pay though\u2026 is it really worth it?Reply     LuxeBeautyGirl says:   October 12, 2009 at 10:58 am  I\u2019ve been using this eye cream loyally since i bought it this summer (yup, i\u2019ve been putting on this intensive eye cream even in the midst of the NYC humid-summer days and it\u2019s been fantastic!)and the fine lines under, around, and even on the top lids vanished away!  not to mention, i never have puffy eyes in the morning anymore! SENSAI just started selling on the Neiman\u2019s website but I think they\u2019re only available in stores at Bergdorf Goodman \u2013 maybe you can try calling their counter (212) 872.2537 to see if you can snag a sample when you buy their popular cleanser or mascara 38C or something to treat your self (and as an excuse!) It\u2019s totally worth it and lasts for at least 3 months even with a twice-a-day application!!Reply     ilyas nasir says:   April 8, 2011 at 8:56 am  pls send me this product.Reply Do you love it or hate it?
