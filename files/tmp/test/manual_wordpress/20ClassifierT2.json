DIE POSER. So good. Just what I want to wear when I\u2019m walking around the crowded streets of NYC and everyone thinks they\u2019re the coolest thing on the planet. \u201CHipster\u201D and \u201CChic\u201D being key words around town. All you\u2019ve got to do is stand dead-on\u2026spread your arms with \u201CDie\u201D written on my chest (tongue out optional), then walk away\u2026\u201DPoser\u201D drawn down your back. I love a good cheeky sweater arriving just before nut-so fashion week to keep me sane. Plus, it\u2019s so darn cute, I wear it with everything. Here, I took it out with the equally badass UNIF \u201CLore\u201D hat and the most amazing feeling jeans known to man. A little shine for a rainy day. Plaid, black skinnies, and of course a classic VANS sneaker is all I need on a busy work week. NYC is SO cold that I\u2019ve been literally dreaming of treehouses, Malaysia, and summer all night\u2026dreading having to layer on an itchy wool coat the next day struggling to keep warm. All I really feel like doing, is curl up under a down blanket in the middle of the week. A girl can dream. \n\n INSTAGRAM (natalieoffduty) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;\/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n    \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        TAGS: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t56 Replies\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t","title_lev":1.0,"text_jar":0.79,"text_cosine":0.9813193663671155,"url":"http:\/\/natalieoffduty.com\/2014\/01\/tongue-out-optional\/"}
