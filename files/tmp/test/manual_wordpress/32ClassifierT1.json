I\u2019ve been out and about, as Missguided\u2019s NYC galll all week, trying to make as many shows as possible, all while still having a normal life! Between work, and shooting, and LONDONTOWN, I haven\u2019t had must rest, but my jetlag is finally wearing off and I\u2019m back in NYC groove! Rather than running amuck in the below 10 degree weather in stilettos (how did they do it?!), all I could do was slide into a pair of leather sneakers, ripped jeans, and call it a day. This SHAGGY SHAG SHAG of a sweater defines me of this winter. I\u2019ve worn it massive amounts. I\u2019ve been all about the oversize layers, and extra long vests. The brown tones here remind of the girls plopped on the garage couch in That 70\u2032s Show\u2026the same warm colors I\u2019d find in my mother\u2019s vintage clothing. But of course, I\u2019m a color girl, so a pop of bright pink lips sealed the deal. I can\u2019t wait for a warm September fashion week everybody!\n\nInstagram (natalieoffduty)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;\/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n    \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        TAGS: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t42 Replies\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t","title_lev":1.0,"text_jar":0.79,"text_cosine":0.9734636116958925,"url":"http:\/\/natalieoffduty.com\/2014\/02\/shag-shag-shimmy-shake\/"}
