{"title":"A bad case of Orange Face | ...love Maegan","text":"By Maegan Tintari unbelievable May 7, 2008\nA bad case of Orange Face\nFor the past three years I\u2019ve been using Bare Minerals make-up and I LOVE IT! Seriously, it takes less than ten minutes to do my make-up in the morning and it\u2019s mostly fool-proof. However, it seems that when I originally purchased the first kit of colors, I was very tan and chose the medium skin tone. It also seems that over the past three years, tanning has been less appealing to me (maybe because our pool is underground and sucks or maybe because my dad died of skin cancer \u2013 could be either?) \u2013 anyway, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m not so tan any more \u2013 but somehow I still thought I was. I would try to add make-up to my neck to blend it but it never EVER really blended right.\nLast week I went to Sephora and decided to try the lighter shade (fairly light instead of just light). I recall trying this color before and it being too pink for me\u2026or at least I thought.\nIt is not until now, face and neck the same (or really close to the same) color that I realize that I have been walking around with orange face for at least two years. I\u2019m not going to lie, someone mentioned to Pep that I shouldn\u2019t wear so much make-up and he informed me of my mistake too. But he just said TOO MUCH MAKE-UP- not THE WRONG COLOR. So it didn\u2019t click for me. I\u2019m going to TRY to pretend that I actually WAS as tan as I thought I was for a while at least, so as not to crawl up into a whole of embarrassment admitting it was THREE YEARS.\nEither way, the first step is realizing the problem. I can say that I\u2019m not in denial any more and no longer have a case of the orange face!\n","title_lev":0.9117647058823529,"text_jar":0.83,"text_cosine":0.9950660357873413,"url":"http:\/\/www.lovemaegan.com\/2008\/05\/a-bad-case-of-orange-face.html"}
