Ive always said, you can wear anything if you wear it confidently right? Maybe it was confidence combined with the fact that the colours actually all worked together\u2026but who can be sure.\nLets take a look at the details.\n\nSunglasses by Rayban\nJacket by Topman\nShirt by TM Lewin (available at Edgars locally)\nTie by Weekend casual (available here)\nTie clip by Weekend Casual (available here)\nLapel Flower by Weekend Casual (available here)\nPocket square by Weekend Casual (available here)\nPants by River Island\nShoes by Dune LondonÂ (available atÂ EdgarsÂ locally)\nOkay.
